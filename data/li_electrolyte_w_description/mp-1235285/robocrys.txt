LiU₂TmS₃O₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five S²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiS₅ square pyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiS₅ square pyramids, edges with four equivalent TmS₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiS₅ square pyramids. There is one shorter (2.41 Å) and four longer (2.75 Å) Li-S bond lengths. There are two inequivalent U³⁺ sites. In the first U³⁺ site, U³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent S²⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms. Both U-S bond lengths are 2.92 Å. There are two shorter (2.24 Å) and two longer (2.25 Å) U-O bond lengths. In the second U³⁺ site, U³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to four equivalent S²⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms. All U-S bond lengths are 2.93 Å. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.41 Å. Tm³⁺ is bonded to six S²⁻ atoms to form TmS₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent TmS₆ octahedra, edges with four equivalent TmS₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiS₅ square pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 5°. There are a spread of Tm-S bond distances ranging from 2.66-2.74 Å. There are three inequivalent S²⁻ sites. In the first S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four equivalent U³⁺ and one Tm³⁺ atom. In the second S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent U³⁺, and one Tm³⁺ atom. In the third S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and four equivalent Tm³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing SLiTm₄ square pyramids. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four U³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OU₄ tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four U³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OU₄ tetrahedra.
