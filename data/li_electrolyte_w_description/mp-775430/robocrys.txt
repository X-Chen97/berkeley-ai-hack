LiBi₃(O₂I)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.11 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four I¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. There are two shorter (3.51 Å) and two longer (3.57 Å) Bi-I bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four I¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. There are a spread of Bi-I bond distances ranging from 3.58-3.66 Å. O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three Bi³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiBi₃ tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent I¹⁻ sites. In the first I¹⁻ site, I¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second I¹⁻ site, I¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms.
