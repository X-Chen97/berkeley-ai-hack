(LiH₄(NO₃)₂)₂N₂ is Indium-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of four LiH₄(NO₃)₂ clusters and four N₂ clusters. In each LiH₄(NO₃)₂ cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (2.06 Å) Li-O bond lengths. N+2.33+ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.24 Å) and one longer (1.26 Å) N-O bond length. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one N+2.33+ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N+2.33+ atom. In each N₂ cluster, N+2.33+ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to  atoms.
