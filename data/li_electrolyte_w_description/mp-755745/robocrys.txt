LiBi(BO₃)₂ is Calcite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-57°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.42 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.38 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond lengths. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-57°. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.16 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom.
