Li₄C₄Bi₂SO₁₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Fddd space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 57-78°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.43 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 57-78°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.65 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.29 Å) and two longer (1.30 Å) C-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share edges with four LiO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.38 Å) and four longer (2.40 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with four LiO₆ octahedra. All S-O bond lengths are 1.50 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
