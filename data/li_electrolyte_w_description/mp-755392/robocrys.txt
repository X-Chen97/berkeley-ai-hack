LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.85-1.94 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.35 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.57 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
