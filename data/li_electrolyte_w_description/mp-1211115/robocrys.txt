LiCa₂TeO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-33°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.21 Å. Ca is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.84 Å. Te is bonded to six O atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-33°. There are two shorter (1.94 Å) and four longer (1.95 Å) Te-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, three equivalent Ca, and one Te atom. In the second O site, O is bonded to one Li, two equivalent Ca, and one Te atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiCa₂Te tetrahedra. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, three equivalent Ca, and one Te atom.
