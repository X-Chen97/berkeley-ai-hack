Li₂ZnGeO₄ is Stannite-like structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic Pc space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.03 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.01 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.01 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.78 Å) and two longer (1.79 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂ZnGe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂ZnGe tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂ZnGe tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂ZnGe tetrahedra.
