Li₂Sm(NO₃)₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnnm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.67 Å. There are two inequivalent Sm³⁺ sites. In the first Sm³⁺ site, Sm³⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SmO₁₂ cuboctahedra. There are a spread of Sm-O bond distances ranging from 2.60-2.65 Å. In the second Sm³⁺ site, Sm³⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SmO₁₂ cuboctahedra. There are a spread of Sm-O bond distances ranging from 2.57-2.73 Å. There are four inequivalent N⁵⁺ sites. In the first N⁵⁺ site, N⁵⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.23 Å) and two longer (1.29 Å) N-O bond lengths. In the second N⁵⁺ site, N⁵⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms.
