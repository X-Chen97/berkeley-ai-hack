Li₄SrCa(SiO₄)₂ is Aluminum carbonitride-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcm space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one CaO₆ octahedra, corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one CaO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 85°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.04 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one CaO₆ octahedra, corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one CaO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 84°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-1.96 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.49-2.99 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form CaO₆ octahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.41 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 59°. There is one shorter (1.63 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent CaO₆ octahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 54-65°. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
