Li₁₄P₂O₃N₆ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent N³⁻ atoms to form distorted LiN₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PN₃O tetrahedra, corners with twelve LiN₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PN₃O tetrahedra, and edges with four LiN₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-N bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.14 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form LiNO₃ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PN₃O tetrahedra, corners with fourteen LiN₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PN₃O tetrahedra, and edges with four LiN₃O tetrahedra. The Li-N bond length is 1.99 Å. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.11 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom to form LiN₃O tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent PN₃O tetrahedra, corners with ten LiN₄ tetrahedra, and edges with six LiN₄ tetrahedra. All Li-N bond lengths are 2.07 Å. The Li-O bond length is 2.02 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to three equivalent N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom to form PN₃O tetrahedra that share corners with twelve LiN₄ tetrahedra and edges with six LiN₄ tetrahedra. All P-N bond lengths are 1.63 Å. The P-O bond length is 1.78 Å. N³⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to six Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to six equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted edge-sharing OLi₆P hexagonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight Li¹⁺ atoms.
