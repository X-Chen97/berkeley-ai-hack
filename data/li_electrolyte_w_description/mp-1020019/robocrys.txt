Li₂PO₂N crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmc2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with five equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and corners with seven equivalent LiNO₃ tetrahedra. The Li-N bond length is 2.10 Å. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.01 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to two equivalent N³⁻ and two equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form PN₂O₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and corners with ten equivalent LiNO₃ tetrahedra. Both P-N bond lengths are 1.64 Å. Both P-O bond lengths are 1.57 Å. N³⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms to form NLi₂P₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NLi₂P₂ tetrahedra and corners with ten equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra. O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃P tetrahedra that share corners with five equivalent NLi₂P₂ tetrahedra and corners with seven equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra.
