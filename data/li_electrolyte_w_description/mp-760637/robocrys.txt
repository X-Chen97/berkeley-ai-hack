LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.48 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.21-2.67 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-69°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 52-62°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.65 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
