Li₃B₂SbO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.09 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.11 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.06 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. Sb³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.79 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Sb³⁺ atoms.
