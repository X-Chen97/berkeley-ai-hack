LiBa₂Zn₂(SO)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three S and one O atom. There are a spread of Li-S bond distances ranging from 2.45-2.69 Å. The Li-O bond length is 1.88 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.75-3.06 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.87-3.28 Å. There are two inequivalent Zn sites. In the first Zn site, Zn is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent S and one O atom. There is one shorter (2.43 Å) and one longer (2.46 Å) Zn-S bond length. The Zn-O bond length is 1.95 Å. In the second Zn site, Zn is bonded to two equivalent S and two O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing ZnS₂O₂ tetrahedra. Both Zn-S bond lengths are 2.43 Å. There is one shorter (1.98 Å) and one longer (2.04 Å) Zn-O bond length. There are two inequivalent S sites. In the first S site, S is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent Zn atoms. In the second S site, S is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li and two equivalent Zn atoms. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and one Zn atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four Ba and two Zn atoms.
