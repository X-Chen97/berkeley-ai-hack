LiH₂O₅Br crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.11 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O¹⁻ and two equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent BrO₄ trigonal pyramids. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O¹⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are two inequivalent O¹⁻ sites. In the first O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one O¹⁻, and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-O bond length is 1.45 Å. The O-Br bond length is 2.19 Å. In the second O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one H¹⁺ and one O¹⁻ atom. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-Br bond length is 2.06 Å. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.66 Å. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.66 Å. Br⁵⁺ is bonded to one O¹⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BrO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids.
