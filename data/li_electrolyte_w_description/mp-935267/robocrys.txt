Li₄UC₃O₁₁ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3c1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.41 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.35 Å. U⁶⁺ is bonded in a distorted hexagonal bipyramidal geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.40 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.27 Å) and two longer (1.31 Å) C-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one U⁶⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one U⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one U⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one U⁶⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₃C tetrahedra.
