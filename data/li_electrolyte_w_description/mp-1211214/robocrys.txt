Li₄Be₃As₃O₁₂Br crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one Br¹⁻ atom to form LiBrO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.99 Å. The Li-Br bond length is 2.63 Å. Be²⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. All Be-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra. All As-O bond lengths are 1.72 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. Br¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
