LiSr₂TeO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 19-20°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.20 Å. Sr is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.59-2.86 Å. Te is bonded to six O atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 19-20°. There are four shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (1.95 Å) Te-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Sr, and one Te atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, three equivalent Sr, and one Te atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, three equivalent Sr, and one Te atom.
