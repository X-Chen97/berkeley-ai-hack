Li₂CaSiO₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅42m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.97 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.39 Å) and four longer (2.76 Å) Ca-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.66 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
