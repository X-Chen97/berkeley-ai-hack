Li(H₂O)₄Al(CO)₄(CF₃)₁₂ is Indium-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅4 space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of two Al(CO)₄ clusters, twenty-four CF₃ clusters, and two Li(H₂O)₄ clusters. In each Al(CO)₄ cluster, Al³⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.76 Å. C²⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The C-O bond length is 1.35 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one C²⁺ atom. In eight of the CF₃ clusters, C²⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-F bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.37 Å. There are three inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁺ atom. In sixteen of the CF₃ clusters, C³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three F¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.35 Å) and one longer (1.37 Å) C-F bond length. There are three inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C³⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C³⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C³⁺ atom. In each Li(H₂O)₄ cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.91 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms.
