Li₂Al₂(SiO₄)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Fdd2 space group. Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.30 Å. Al is bonded to four O atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.73-1.78 Å. There are two inequivalent Si sites. In the first Si site, Si is bonded to four O atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.62 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si site, Si is bonded to four O atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.63 Å) and one longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Si atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Si atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Si atoms. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Li atoms. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al and one Si atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Si atom.
