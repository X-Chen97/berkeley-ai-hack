LiBi(BO₃)₂ is Calcite-derived structured and crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 58°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.22 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.38 Å. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 58°. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.17 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom.
