CsLi₂(HO)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three H¹⁺ and four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (3.19 Å) and two longer (3.23 Å) Cs-H bond lengths. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.06-3.27 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-1.95 Å. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Cs¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Cs¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
