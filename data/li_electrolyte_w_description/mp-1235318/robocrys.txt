LiSrU₂O₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.29 Å) and four longer (2.39 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.53 Å) and four longer (2.55 Å) Sr-O bond lengths. U+4.50+ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.31 Å) and six longer (2.35 Å) U-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, and three equivalent U+4.50+ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and two equivalent U+4.50+ atoms.
