LiPu₂TeO₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/mmm space group. Li is bonded to two equivalent Pu and four equivalent Te atoms to form LiPu₂Te₄ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiPu₂Te₄ octahedra, corners with eight equivalent OPu₄ tetrahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiPu₂Te₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. Both Li-Pu bond lengths are 2.88 Å. All Li-Te bond lengths are 2.84 Å. Pu is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li and four equivalent O atoms. All Pu-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. Te is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four equivalent Li atoms. O is bonded to four equivalent Pu atoms to form OPu₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiPu₂Te₄ octahedra, corners with four equivalent OPu₄ tetrahedra, and edges with four equivalent OPu₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 61°.
