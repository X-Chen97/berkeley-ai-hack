LiSn(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.07 Å) and two longer (2.46 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.21 Å) and two longer (2.25 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 48°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-50°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.62 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sn³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sn³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
