LiAlSiO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.00 Å) and two longer (2.04 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.06 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.75 Å) and two longer (1.76 Å) Al-O bond lengths. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.76 Å) and two longer (1.78 Å) Al-O bond lengths. In the third Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.75 Å) and two longer (1.76 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.63 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.63 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the third Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.62 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two Si⁴⁺ atoms.
