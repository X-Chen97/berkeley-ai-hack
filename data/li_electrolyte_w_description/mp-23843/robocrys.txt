LiHSeO₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.05 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.02 Å) and one longer (1.60 Å) H-O bond length. Se⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.69-1.84 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Se⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Se⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Se⁴⁺ atom.
