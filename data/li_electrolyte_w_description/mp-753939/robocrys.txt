LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent SnO₆ pentagonal pyramids, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.73 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent SnO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-85°. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.35-2.72 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent SnO₆ pentagonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SnO₆ pentagonal pyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-53°. There is one shorter (1.53 Å) and three longer (1.58 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SnP trigonal pyramids.
