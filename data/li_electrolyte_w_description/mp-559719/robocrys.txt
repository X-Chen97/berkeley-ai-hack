LiPr(SO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.09 Å. Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.42-2.68 Å. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.51 Å. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.52 Å. There are eight inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Pr³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
