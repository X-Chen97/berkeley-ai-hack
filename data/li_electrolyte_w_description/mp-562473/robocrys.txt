LiSn₂P₃O₁₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.00 Å) and three longer (2.04 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 25-45°. There are two shorter (1.52 Å) and two longer (1.53 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
