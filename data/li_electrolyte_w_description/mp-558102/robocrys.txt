LiKSi₂O₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.77-3.29 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with five SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.13 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.59-1.67 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.60-1.67 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to three equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms.
