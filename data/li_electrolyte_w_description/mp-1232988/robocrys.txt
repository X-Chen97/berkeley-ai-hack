LiPr₂Zn₂(PO)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R3m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Zn²⁺, three equivalent P³⁻, and one O²⁻ atom. The Li-Zn bond length is 2.21 Å. All Li-P bond lengths are 2.61 Å. The Li-O bond length is 1.90 Å. Pr²⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent P³⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms. All Pr-P bond lengths are 3.12 Å. There are three shorter (2.44 Å) and one longer (2.66 Å) Pr-O bond length. Pr³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PrO₄ trigonal pyramids. There is one shorter (2.26 Å) and three longer (2.38 Å) Pr-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Zn²⁺ sites. In the first Zn²⁺ site, Zn²⁺ is bonded to four P³⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing ZnP₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.46 Å) and one longer (2.81 Å) Zn-P bond length. In the second Zn²⁺ site, Zn²⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and four P³⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.35 Å) and three longer (2.63 Å) Zn-P bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P³⁻ sites. In the first P³⁻ site, P³⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and four Zn²⁺ atoms. In the second P³⁻ site, P³⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Pr²⁺ and four Zn²⁺ atoms. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Pr²⁺, and three equivalent Pr³⁺ atoms to form distorted OLiPr₄ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with six equivalent OLiPr₄ trigonal bipyramids and edges with three equivalent OPr₄ tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Pr³⁺ and three equivalent Pr²⁺ atoms to form OPr₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent OPr₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent OLiPr₄ trigonal bipyramids.
