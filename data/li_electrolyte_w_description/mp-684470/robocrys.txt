Li₃Sn₂P₅O₁₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent SnO₅ square pyramids, corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.29 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.92 Å) and two longer (2.30 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₅ square pyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.64 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₅ square pyramids,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.65 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₅ square pyramids and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra.
