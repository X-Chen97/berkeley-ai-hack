LiCsSO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 11-coordinate geometry to eleven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.23-3.71 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (1.96 Å) Li-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.50 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to four equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to three equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
