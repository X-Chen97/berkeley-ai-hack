LiBi₂As₂(PbO₅)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.91 Å) and two longer (2.45 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Pb²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.34-2.76 Å. Bi+2.50+ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.66 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.72-1.75 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Pb²⁺, one Bi+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Pb²⁺, one Bi+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Pb²⁺, one Bi+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Pb²⁺, one Bi+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Pb²⁺, and one Bi+2.50+ atom.
