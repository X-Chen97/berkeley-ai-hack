LiZn₄(SnO₂)₄ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ trigonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.28 Å. There are two inequivalent Zn sites. In the first Zn site, Zn is bonded to four O atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent ZnO₄ trigonal pyramids, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.07 Å. In the second Zn site, Zn is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted ZnO₄ trigonal pyramids that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 38°. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.07 Å. There are two inequivalent Sn sites. In the first Sn site, Sn is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to two equivalent O atoms. There is one shorter (2.20 Å) and one longer (2.24 Å) Sn-O bond length. In the second Sn site, Sn is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.16-2.36 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to two equivalent Li, one Zn, and two equivalent Sn atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₂ZnSn₂ trigonal bipyramids. In the second O site, O is bonded to two equivalent Zn and two equivalent Sn atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OZn₂Sn₂ trigonal pyramids. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to one Li and three Zn atoms. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Zn and two equivalent Sn atoms.
