Li₄Al₃Si₃O₁₂Cl crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one Cl¹⁻ atom to form LiClO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. The Li-Cl bond length is 2.58 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.77 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
