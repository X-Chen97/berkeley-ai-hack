LiBa₃(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. Li is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.19 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.57-3.05 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded to twelve O atoms to form distorted BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra and edges with six equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are six shorter (2.93 Å) and six longer (3.41 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. As is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted AsO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with three equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. There is one shorter (1.75 Å) and three longer (1.80 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four Ba and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and one As atom.
