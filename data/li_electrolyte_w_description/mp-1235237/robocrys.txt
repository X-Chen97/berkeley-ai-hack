LiPr₂Zn₂(PO)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. Li is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.46 Å. Pr is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent P and four equivalent O atoms. All Pr-P bond lengths are 3.03 Å. There are three shorter (2.51 Å) and one longer (2.61 Å) Pr-O bond length. Zn is bonded to four equivalent P atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing ZnP₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.42 Å) and one longer (2.55 Å) Zn-P bond length. P is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Pr and four equivalent Zn atoms. O is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li and four equivalent Pr atoms.
