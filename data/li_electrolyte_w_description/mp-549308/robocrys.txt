LiBGeO₄ is Chalcostibite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Fmm2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.13 Å) Li-O bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.54 Å) B-O bond lengths. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.78 Å) and two longer (1.80 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
