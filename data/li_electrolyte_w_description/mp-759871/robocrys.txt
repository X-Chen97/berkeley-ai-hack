LiBi(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.88 Å) and two longer (2.49 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.30-2.50 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 63°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 18-46°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.59 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms.
