LiLa₂HO₃ is (La,Ba)CuO4-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent H¹⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiH₂O₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. Both Li-H bond lengths are 1.79 Å. There are two shorter (1.90 Å) and two longer (2.29 Å) Li-O bond lengths. La³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to two equivalent H¹⁻ and seven O²⁻ atoms. Both La-H bond lengths are 2.59 Å. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.66 Å. H¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four equivalent La³⁺ atoms. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four equivalent La³⁺ atoms to form distorted OLi₂La₄ octahedra that share corners with fourteen OLi₂La₄ octahedra, edges with two equivalent OLi₂La₄ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent OLiLa₅ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-52°. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and five equivalent La³⁺ atoms to form distorted OLiLa₅ octahedra that share corners with eleven OLi₂La₄ octahedra, edges with eight equivalent OLiLa₅ octahedra, and faces with two equivalent OLi₂La₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-52°.
