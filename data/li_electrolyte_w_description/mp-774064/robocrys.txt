LiSb(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-50°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.34 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-50°. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.05 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra.
