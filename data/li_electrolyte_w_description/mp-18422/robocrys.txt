RbLiZn₂O₃ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4₂/mnm space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (3.02 Å) and four longer (3.18 Å) Rb-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with seven equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.09 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and three equivalent Zn²⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Rb¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and two equivalent Zn²⁺ atoms.
