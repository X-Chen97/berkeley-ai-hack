Cs₄Li(Pb₂O₃)₂ is Brookite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are two inequivalent Cs sites. In the first Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There are two shorter (3.16 Å) and one longer (3.18 Å) Cs-O bond length. In the second Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.12-3.60 Å. Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There are two shorter (1.89 Å) and one longer (1.92 Å) Li-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Pb sites. In the first Pb site, Pb is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.24-2.29 Å. In the second Pb site, Pb is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.25 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs, one Li, and two Pb atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs, one Li, and two equivalent Pb atoms. In the third O site, O is bonded to four Cs and two equivalent Pb atoms to form a mixture of face and corner-sharing OCs₄Pb₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 51-61°. In the fourth O site, O is bonded to four Cs and two Pb atoms to form a mixture of edge, corner, and face-sharing OCs₄Pb₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 51-61°.
