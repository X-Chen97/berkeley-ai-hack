KLi₂HO₃H₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. The structure consists of two H₂ clusters inside a KLi₂HO₃ framework. In each H₂ cluster, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one H¹⁺ atom. The H-H bond length is 0.75 Å. In the KLi₂HO₃ framework, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.55-3.14 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one H¹⁺ and four O²⁻ atoms. The Li-H bond length is 2.01 Å. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.10 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one O²⁻ atom. The O-O bond length is 1.53 Å. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three equivalent K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one O²⁻ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom.
