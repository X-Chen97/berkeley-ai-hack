LiAsH₂₀(C₂O)₄ is gamma plutonium structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of four LiAsH₂₀(C₂O)₄ clusters. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one As¹⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms. The Li-As bond length is 2.75 Å. There are two shorter (2.08 Å) and two longer (2.19 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent C¹⁻ sites. In the first C¹⁻ site, C¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.10 Å) and one longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond length. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. In the second C¹⁻ site, C¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.10 Å) and one longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond length. The C-O bond length is 1.44 Å. There are two inequivalent C²⁻ sites. In the first C²⁻ site, C²⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.09 Å) and two longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond lengths. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. In the second C²⁻ site, C²⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There are two shorter (1.10 Å) and one longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond length. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. As¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺ atom. There are ten inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom.

In the seventh H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the eighth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the ninth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the tenth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C¹⁻, and one C²⁻ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C¹⁻, and one C²⁻ atom.
