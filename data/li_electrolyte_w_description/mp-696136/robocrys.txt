Li₁₀Sn(PO₆)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4₂mc space group. There are four inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.57 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.28 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.25 Å. In the fourth Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.14 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (1.99 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra.
