LiBa₂Zn₂(SO)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Ba, two S, and two equivalent O atoms. The Li-Ba bond length is 3.03 Å. There is one shorter (2.58 Å) and one longer (2.67 Å) Li-S bond length. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to four S and two equivalent O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-S bond distances ranging from 3.19-3.38 Å. There is one shorter (2.82 Å) and one longer (2.83 Å) Ba-O bond length. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Zn, four S, and two equivalent O atoms. There is one shorter (3.38 Å) and one longer (3.39 Å) Ba-Zn bond length. There are a spread of Ba-S bond distances ranging from 3.17-3.39 Å. There is one shorter (3.16 Å) and one longer (3.17 Å) Ba-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Zn sites. In the first Zn site, Zn is bonded to two equivalent S and two O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing ZnS₂O₂ tetrahedra. Both Zn-S bond lengths are 2.41 Å. There is one shorter (1.96 Å) and one longer (2.01 Å) Zn-O bond length. In the second Zn site, Zn is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Ba, two equivalent S, and two O atoms. There is one shorter (2.42 Å) and one longer (2.43 Å) Zn-S bond length. There is one shorter (1.98 Å) and one longer (2.09 Å) Zn-O bond length. There are two inequivalent S sites. In the first S site, S is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and two equivalent Zn atoms. In the second S site, S is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and two equivalent Zn atoms. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to four Ba and two Zn atoms to form distorted edge-sharing OBa₄Zn₂ octahedra. In the second O site, O is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li and two Zn atoms.
