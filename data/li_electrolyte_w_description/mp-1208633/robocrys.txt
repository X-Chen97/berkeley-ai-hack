LiSrPO₄ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.86 Å) and three longer (1.95 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a distorted q6 geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.60-2.94 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All P-O bond lengths are 1.55 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Sr²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
