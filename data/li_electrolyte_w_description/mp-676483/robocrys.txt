LiNaZnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222₁ space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form NaO₅ square pyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.46-2.62 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NaO₅ square pyramids, corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NaO₅ square pyramids, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. All Zn-O bond lengths are 1.98 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent NaO₅ square pyramids,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.65 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Na¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
