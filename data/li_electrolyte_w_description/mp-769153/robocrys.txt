Li₂SbSO₄F₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.38 Å. There is one shorter (1.94 Å) and one longer (2.61 Å) Li-F bond length. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-F bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.59 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.31 Å) and one longer (2.43 Å) Sb-O bond length. There are a spread of Sb-F bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.09 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.54 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. There are three inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom.
