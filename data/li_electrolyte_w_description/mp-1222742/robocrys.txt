Li₂MgSiO₄ is beta beryllia-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.03 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one MgO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.12 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.00 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.64 Å) and two longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgSi trigonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgSi tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgSi tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂MgSi tetrahedra.
