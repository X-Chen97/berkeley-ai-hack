Li₂U₃P₂O₁₅ crystallizes in the tetragonal I4₁/amd space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.84 Å) and two longer (2.08 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent U⁶⁺ sites. In the first U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.81-2.55 Å. In the second U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.79 Å) and four longer (2.34 Å) U-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent UO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 36°. There are two shorter (1.53 Å) and two longer (1.54 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one U⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one U⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent U⁶⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one U⁶⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent U⁶⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
