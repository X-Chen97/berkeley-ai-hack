LiAs(HO₂)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.99 Å) and one longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond length. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.68-1.77 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.52 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.52 Å) H-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one As⁵⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one As⁵⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one As⁵⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
