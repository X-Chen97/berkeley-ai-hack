Li₂B₃O₄F₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₂F₂ tetrahedra that share corners with four BO₃F tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.93 Å) and one longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond length. There is one shorter (1.87 Å) and one longer (1.88 Å) Li-F bond length. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.06 Å. There is one shorter (1.83 Å) and one longer (2.55 Å) Li-F bond length. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form BO₃F tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₂F₂ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one BO₂F₂ tetrahedra. All B-O bond lengths are 1.45 Å. The B-F bond length is 1.45 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to two O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms to form BO₂F₂ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BO₃F tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₂F₂ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.43 Å) and one longer (1.45 Å) B-O bond length. There is one shorter (1.43 Å) and one longer (1.45 Å) B-F bond length. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.36 Å) and two longer (1.37 Å) B-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂B₂ tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. There are three inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom.
