LiSrAl₂B₂O₇ crystallizes in the trigonal R3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.05 Å) and three longer (2.19 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.50 Å) and three longer (2.79 Å) Sr-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing AlO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.70 Å) and three longer (1.79 Å) Al-O bond lengths. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing AlO₄ trigonal pyramids. There is one shorter (1.66 Å) and three longer (1.82 Å) Al-O bond lengths. B²⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.40 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B²⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two Al³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
