LiBa₂UO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnnm space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent UO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 2-5°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.18 Å. Ba is bonded to twelve O atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent UO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.91-3.13 Å. U is bonded to six O atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 2-5°. There are two shorter (2.06 Å) and four longer (2.07 Å) U-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, four equivalent Ba, and one U atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, four equivalent Ba, and one U atom.
