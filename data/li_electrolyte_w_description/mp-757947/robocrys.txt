Li₂Sn(PO₃)₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.68 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.26 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra.
