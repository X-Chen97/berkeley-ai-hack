Cs₂LiNd(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcm space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The Cs-O bond length is 2.89 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.07 Å. Nd³⁺ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing NdO₈ hexagonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.86 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.39 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Nd³⁺ and one B³⁺ atom.
