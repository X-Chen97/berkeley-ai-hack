LiAl₂(HO₂)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (2.32 Å) and two longer (2.35 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Al sites. In the first Al site, Al is bonded to six O atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 21°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-1.95 Å. In the second Al site, Al is bonded to six O atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 22°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-1.95 Å. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 1.03 Å. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 1.02 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to four Al atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing OAl₄ trigonal pyramids. In the second O site, O is bonded to four Al atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing OAl₄ trigonal pyramids. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Li, two equivalent Al, and one H atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Li, two equivalent Al, and one H atom.
