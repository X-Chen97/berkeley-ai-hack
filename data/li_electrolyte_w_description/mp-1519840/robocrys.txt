LiPr(GeO₃)₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/mmm space group. Li is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.64 Å. Pr is bonded to twelve O atoms to form PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with four equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra and faces with eight equivalent GeO₆ octahedra. There are eight shorter (2.58 Å) and four longer (2.64 Å) Pr-O bond lengths. Ge is bonded to six O atoms to form GeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent GeO₆ octahedra and faces with two equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-12°. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.81-2.01 Å. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Pr and two equivalent Ge atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Pr and two equivalent Ge atoms. In the third O site, O is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent Ge atoms.
