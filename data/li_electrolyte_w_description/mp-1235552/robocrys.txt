LiSrAlO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.10 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.60-2.82 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing AlO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.80-1.89 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent Sr²⁺, and one Al³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OSr₄LiAl octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 5°.
