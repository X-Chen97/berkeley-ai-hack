LiBaTbSbO₆ crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. The structure consists of four Li clusters inside a BaTbSbO₆ framework. In each Li cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 12-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the BaTbSbO₆ framework, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent TbO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 3.00 Å. Tb⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form TbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Tb-O bond lengths are 2.24 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TbO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Sb-O bond lengths are 2.00 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Ba²⁺, one Tb⁴⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
