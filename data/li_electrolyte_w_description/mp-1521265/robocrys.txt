LiBaTbSbO₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnnn space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.87 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.83 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba²⁺ sites. In the first Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with two equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent TbO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.95-3.00 Å. In the second Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with two equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent TbO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.84-3.12 Å. Tb⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and faces with four BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 7-9°. There are two shorter (2.24 Å) and four longer (2.25 Å) Tb-O bond lengths. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TbO₆ octahedra and faces with four BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 7-9°. There are four shorter (2.00 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two Ba²⁺, one Tb⁴⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Ba²⁺, one Tb⁴⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Ba²⁺, one Tb⁴⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
