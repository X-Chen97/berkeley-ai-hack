LiPr₂(O₂Br)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to one O¹⁻ and three Br¹⁻ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing LiBr₃O tetrahedra. The Li-O bond length is 1.93 Å. There is one shorter (2.47 Å) and two longer (2.57 Å) Li-Br bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Pr³⁺ sites. In the first Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ and five O¹⁻ atoms. The Pr-O bond length is 2.44 Å. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.35-2.44 Å. In the second Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O²⁻, four O¹⁻, and three Br¹⁻ atoms. Both Pr-O bond lengths are 2.35 Å. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.46-2.65 Å. There is one shorter (3.08 Å) and two longer (3.42 Å) Pr-Br bond lengths. O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three Pr³⁺ atoms. There are three inequivalent O¹⁻ sites. In the first O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and three Pr³⁺ atoms. In the second O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Pr³⁺ and one O¹⁻ atom. The O-O bond length is 1.51 Å. In the third O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded to three Pr³⁺ and one O¹⁻ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OPr₃O tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent Br¹⁻ sites. In the first Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Pr³⁺ atoms. In the second Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Pr³⁺ atom.
