LiPr₂(O₂Br)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O and three Br atoms. There is one shorter (1.92 Å) and one longer (2.63 Å) Li-O bond length. There are a spread of Li-Br bond distances ranging from 2.61-2.71 Å. There are two inequivalent Pr sites. In the first Pr site, Pr is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O and three Br atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.47 Å. There are a spread of Pr-Br bond distances ranging from 3.13-3.49 Å. In the second Pr site, Pr is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to five O and three Br atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.55 Å. There are a spread of Pr-Br bond distances ranging from 3.14-3.35 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li and two Pr atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded to three Pr and one O atom to form distorted corner-sharing OPr₃O tetrahedra. The O-O bond length is 1.49 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three Pr atoms. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted pentagonal planar geometry to one Li, three Pr, and one O atom. There are two inequivalent Br sites. In the first Br site, Br is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li and three Pr atoms. In the second Br site, Br is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li and three Pr atoms.
