Li₂P(HO)₆ crystallizes in the cubic Ia̅3 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.21 Å. P⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All P-O bond lengths are 1.55 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁴⁺ atom.
