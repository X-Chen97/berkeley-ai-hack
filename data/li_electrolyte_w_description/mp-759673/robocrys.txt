LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.96 Å) and one longer (2.00 Å) Li-O bond length. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.26-2.50 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-60°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.64 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-63°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.62 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
