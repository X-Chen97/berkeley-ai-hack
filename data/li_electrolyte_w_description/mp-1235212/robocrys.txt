LiBa₃(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra and faces with two equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.27 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.55-3.08 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded to twelve O atoms to form distorted BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, edges with six equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra, and faces with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.93-3.41 Å. As is bonded to four O atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and edges with three equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 13-16°. There is one shorter (1.76 Å) and three longer (1.79 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four Ba and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, four Ba, and one As atom.
