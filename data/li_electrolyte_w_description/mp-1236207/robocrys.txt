LiAlAsO₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅4 space group. Li is bonded to four equivalent O atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. Al is bonded to four equivalent O atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.79 Å. As is bonded to four equivalent O atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All As-O bond lengths are 1.86 Å. O is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one As atom.
