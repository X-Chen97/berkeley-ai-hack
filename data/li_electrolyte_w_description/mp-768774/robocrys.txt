LiB₃Bi₄O₁₁ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal pyramidal geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.06 Å) and two longer (2.12 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.40 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.41 Å) B-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.26 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.14-2.96 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Bi³⁺ atoms.
