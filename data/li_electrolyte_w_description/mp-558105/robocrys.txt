LiB₆O₉F crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form LiO₄F trigonal bipyramids that share  a cornercorner with one BO₃F tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one BO₃F tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.17 Å. The Li-F bond length is 2.03 Å. There are six inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.37 Å) and one longer (1.38 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.40 Å. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form BO₃F tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄F trigonal bipyramid and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄F trigonal bipyramid. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.49 Å) B-O bond length. The B-F bond length is 1.47 Å. In the fourth B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms.
