Li₃B(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.63 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.01 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.17 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.50 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.52 Å) and two longer (1.60 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra.
