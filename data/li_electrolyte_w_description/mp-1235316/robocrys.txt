Rb₂LiPu(OCl₂)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent Rb¹⁺ sites. In the first Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to two O²⁻ and seven Cl¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.98 Å) and one longer (3.26 Å) Rb-O bond length. There are a spread of Rb-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.35-3.65 Å. In the second Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to two O²⁻ and seven Cl¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (3.19 Å) and one longer (3.36 Å) Rb-O bond length. There are a spread of Rb-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.25-3.60 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ and three Cl¹⁻ atoms. The Li-O bond length is 1.94 Å. There are a spread of Li-Cl bond distances ranging from 2.34-3.29 Å. Pu⁵⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ and two Cl¹⁻ atoms.
