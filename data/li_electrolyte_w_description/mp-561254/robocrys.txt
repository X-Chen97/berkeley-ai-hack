NaLi₃GeO₄ is Aluminum carbonitride-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I4₁/a space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.46-2.83 Å. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.20 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.19 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.98 Å) and one longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond length. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.78 Å) and one longer (1.79 Å) Ge-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
