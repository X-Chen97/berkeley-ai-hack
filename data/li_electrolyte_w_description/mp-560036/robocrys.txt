Li₂Ca₃Be₃Si₃(O₆F)₂ crystallizes in the cubic I2_13 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form LiO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.01 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.92 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form LiO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.03 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.88 Å. There are two inequivalent Ca²⁺ sites. In the first Ca²⁺ site, Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.48-2.58 Å. Both Ca-F bond lengths are 2.45 Å. In the second Ca²⁺ site, Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.43-2.66 Å. Both Ca-F bond lengths are 2.42 Å. Be²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two LiO₃F tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.67 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two LiO₃F tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.64 Å) and one longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Ca²⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Ca²⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Ca²⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing FLiCa₃ tetrahedra. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Ca²⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing FLiCa₃ tetrahedra.
