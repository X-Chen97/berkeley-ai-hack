LiNdGeO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.04 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Nd³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.65 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.77 Å) and two longer (1.81 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Nd³⁺ and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
