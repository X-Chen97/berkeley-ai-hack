Li₁₀Ge(PO₆)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4₂mc space group. There are four inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.33 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.23 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.21 Å. In the fourth Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.20 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.78 Å) and two longer (1.79 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 34-39°. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.58 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites.
