(Li₂Th₅F₂₂)₂O₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P42_12 space group. The structure consists of two O₂ clusters inside a Li₂Th₅F₂₂ framework. In each O₂ cluster, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to  atoms. In the Li₂Th₅F₂₂ framework, Li is bonded to six F atoms to form corner-sharing LiF₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are a spread of Li-F bond distances ranging from 1.72-2.00 Å. There are three inequivalent Th sites. In the first Th site, Th is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine F atoms. There are a spread of Th-F bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.49 Å. In the second Th site, Th is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine F atoms. There are a spread of Th-F bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.50 Å. In the third Th site, Th is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight F atoms. All Th-F bond lengths are 2.39 Å. There are seven inequivalent F sites. In the first F site, F is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li and two Th atoms. In the second F site, F is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent Th atoms. In the third F site, F is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Th atoms. In the fourth F site, F is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Th atoms. In the fifth F site, F is bonded in a linear geometry to two Th atoms. In the sixth F site, F is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li and two Th atoms. In the seventh F site, F is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent Th atoms.
