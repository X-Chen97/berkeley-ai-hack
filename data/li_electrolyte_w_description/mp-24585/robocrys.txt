LiZnPH₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.01 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.99 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.56 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Zn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
