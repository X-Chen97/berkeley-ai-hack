Li(SO₂)₄(BCl)₆ is Indium-derived structured and crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of twelve BCl clusters and one Li(SO₂)₄ cluster. In each BCl cluster, B¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Cl¹⁻ atom. The B-Cl bond length is 1.80 Å. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one B¹⁺ atom. In the Li(SO₂)₄ cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.28 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.45 Å) and one longer (1.46 Å) S-O bond length. There are three inequivalent S⁴⁺ sites. In the first S⁴⁺ site, S⁴⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.45 Å. In the second S⁴⁺ site, S⁴⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.45 Å. In the third S⁴⁺ site, S⁴⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.45 Å. There are eight inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one S³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one S⁴⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the eighth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one S⁴⁺ atom.
