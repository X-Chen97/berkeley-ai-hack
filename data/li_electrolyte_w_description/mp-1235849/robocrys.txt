LiPr₂Zn₂(PO)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. Li is bonded to six equivalent Zn and six equivalent P atoms to form face-sharing LiZn₆P₆ cuboctahedra. All Li-Zn bond lengths are 2.64 Å. All Li-P bond lengths are 2.84 Å. Pr is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent P and four equivalent O atoms. All Pr-P bond lengths are 3.18 Å. There is one shorter (2.36 Å) and three longer (2.48 Å) Pr-O bond lengths. Zn is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li and four equivalent P atoms. There are three shorter (2.44 Å) and one longer (2.61 Å) Zn-P bond length. P is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li, three equivalent Pr, and four equivalent Zn atoms. O is bonded to four equivalent Pr atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing OPr₄ tetrahedra.
