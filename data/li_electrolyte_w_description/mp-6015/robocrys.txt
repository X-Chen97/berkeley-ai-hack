LiSiON crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pca2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiNO₃ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent SiN₃O tetrahedra. The Li-N bond length is 2.30 Å. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-1.97 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to three equivalent N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom to form SiN₃O tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiNO₃ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent SiN₃O tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.75 Å) and one longer (1.76 Å) Si-N bond length. The Si-O bond length is 1.60 Å. N³⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms to form distorted NLiSi₃ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent NLiSi₃ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent OLi₃Si tetrahedra. O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃Si tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent NLiSi₃ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent OLi₃Si tetrahedra.
