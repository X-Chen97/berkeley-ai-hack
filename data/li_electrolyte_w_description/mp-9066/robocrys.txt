NaLi₂AsO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pmn2₁ space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.40 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.06 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.72 Å) and two longer (1.73 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing ONaLi₂As trigonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing ONaLi₂As trigonal pyramids.
