LiCd₂Al₄O₈ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. Li is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and edges with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 13°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.24 Å. Cd is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There is one shorter (2.10 Å) and three longer (2.25 Å) Cd-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Al sites. In the first Al site, Al is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form distorted AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and edges with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 13°. All Al-O bond lengths are 2.10 Å. In the second Al site, Al is bonded to six O atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and edges with six AlO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.89 Å) and four longer (2.00 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to one Cd and three equivalent Al atoms to form OAl₃Cd tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent OAl₃Cd tetrahedra, corners with nine equivalent OLiAl₃Cd trigonal bipyramids, and edges with three equivalent OLiAl₃Cd trigonal bipyramids. In the second O site, O is bonded to one Li, one Cd, and three Al atoms to form distorted OLiAl₃Cd trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent OAl₃Cd tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent OLiAl₃Cd trigonal bipyramids,  an edgeedge with one OAl₃Cd tetrahedra, and edges with six equivalent OLiAl₃Cd trigonal bipyramids.
