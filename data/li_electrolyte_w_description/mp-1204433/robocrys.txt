LiAlGeO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.07 Å. Al is bonded to four O atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.76-1.79 Å. Ge is bonded to four O atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.75-1.79 Å. There are five inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al and one Ge atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Ge atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Ge atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Ge atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li atom.
