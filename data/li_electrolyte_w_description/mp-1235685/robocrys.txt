Rb₄Li(Se₂O₇)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are two inequivalent Rb sites. In the first Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.84-3.41 Å. In the second Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.81-3.44 Å. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.10 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Se sites. In the first Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form SeO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.66-1.94 Å. In the second Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form SeO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.86 Å. There are eight inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Rb and one Se atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Rb, one Li, and one Se atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to three Rb, one Li, and one Se atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent Rb and one Se atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Se atoms. In the eighth O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Se atoms.
