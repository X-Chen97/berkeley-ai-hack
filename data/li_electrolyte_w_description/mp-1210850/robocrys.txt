Li₂In(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.32 Å. In is bonded to six O atoms to form InO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.18 Å) and two longer (2.20 Å) In-O bond lengths. P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent InO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 28-57°. There is one shorter (1.54 Å) and three longer (1.55 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one In, and one P atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one In, and one P atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li and one P atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li, one In, and one P atom.
