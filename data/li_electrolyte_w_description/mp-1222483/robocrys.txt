LiBi₃(O₂Br)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Amm2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. There are three inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Br¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.27 Å. There are two shorter (3.47 Å) and two longer (3.55 Å) Bi-Br bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Br¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. There are two shorter (3.36 Å) and two longer (3.43 Å) Bi-Br bond lengths. In the third Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Br¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.29 Å. There are two shorter (3.34 Å) and two longer (3.41 Å) Bi-Br bond lengths. O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three Bi³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiBi₃ tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent Br¹⁻ sites. In the first Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms.
