LiB₂BiO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 39-70°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.15 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.36 Å) and one longer (1.44 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.33-1.44 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.39 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.22 Å) and two longer (2.34 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two B³⁺ and one Bi³⁺ atom.
