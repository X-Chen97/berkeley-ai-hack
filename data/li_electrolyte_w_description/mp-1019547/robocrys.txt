Li₂BaMgP₂O₈ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 70°. There are three shorter (2.00 Å) and one longer (2.19 Å) Li-O bond length. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, edges with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and faces with two equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. There are six shorter (2.87 Å) and six longer (2.96 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. Mg²⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and faces with two equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. All Mg-O bond lengths are 2.13 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 42°. There is one shorter (1.55 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ba²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ba²⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
