Rb₂Li(SbO₂)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are two inequivalent Rb sites. In the first Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O atoms. There are two shorter (2.90 Å) and two longer (3.06 Å) Rb-O bond lengths. In the second Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.82-3.15 Å. Li is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.93 Å. There are two inequivalent Sb sites. In the first Sb site, Sb is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Sb-O bond lengths are 1.97 Å. In the second Sb site, Sb is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (2.23 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Rb, one Li, and one Sb atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Rb and two Sb atoms.
