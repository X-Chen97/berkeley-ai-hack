LiBi(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.65 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.20 Å) and two longer (2.27 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent BiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.58 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.66 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
