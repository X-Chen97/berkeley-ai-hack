LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.24 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.42 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 25-55°. There are two shorter (1.51 Å) and two longer (1.60 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 16-56°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.63 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms.
