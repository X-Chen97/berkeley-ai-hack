Li₂Ba₅(TeO₅)₃ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six TeO₆ octahedra and faces with eight BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 1-10°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.41 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba²⁺ sites.
