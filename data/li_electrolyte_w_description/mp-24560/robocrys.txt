LiB₂H₃O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnna space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.06 Å. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.47 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.39 Å. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. All B-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.00 Å) and one longer (1.65 Å) H-O bond length. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.69 Å) H-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two B³⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two B³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiB₂H tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
