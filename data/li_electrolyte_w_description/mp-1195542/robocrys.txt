Rb₂LiNd(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcm space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.83-3.54 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NdO₈ hexagonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one NdO₈ hexagonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.84-1.95 Å. Nd³⁺ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted NdO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent NdO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-2.63 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.37 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Rb¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four equivalent Rb¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
