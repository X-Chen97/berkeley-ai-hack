Rb₄Li(Se₂O₇)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Rb sites. In the first Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.90-3.50 Å. In the second Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.92-3.11 Å. Li is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (2.05 Å) and two longer (2.10 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Se sites. In the first Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form corner-sharing SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.65-1.78 Å. In the second Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.67-2.18 Å. There are seven inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two Rb and one Se atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Rb and one Se atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a distorted L-shaped geometry to one Rb, one Li, and one Se atom. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li and two Se atoms.
