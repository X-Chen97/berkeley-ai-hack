LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.04 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.21-3.06 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra.
