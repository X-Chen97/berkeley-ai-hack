Li₂P₂H₂O₇ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.92 Å) and two longer (1.96 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.16 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.62 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent H¹⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
