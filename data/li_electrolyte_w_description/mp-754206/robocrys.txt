LiBi₃O₄Cl₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Cl¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.25 Å) and two longer (2.26 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are a spread of Bi-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.33-3.42 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. There are two shorter (3.21 Å) and two longer (3.29 Å) Bi-Cl bond lengths. O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three Bi³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLiBi₃ tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent Cl¹⁻ sites. In the first Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms.
