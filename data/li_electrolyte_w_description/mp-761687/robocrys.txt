LiSbPO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cc space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.23 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.34 Å. P⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 41-50°. There are two shorter (1.56 Å) and two longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Sb⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb⁵⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb⁵⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb⁵⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sb⁵⁺ and one P⁴⁺ atom.
