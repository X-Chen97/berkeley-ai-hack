Li₂Sn(OH)₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 54-59°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.08 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.12 Å. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
