K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 3.03-3.15 Å. There is one shorter (2.57 Å) and two longer (2.74 Å) K-F bond lengths. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. Both K-O bond lengths are 3.00 Å. There is one shorter (2.72 Å) and two longer (2.75 Å) K-F bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.42 Å) Li-O bond lengths. The Li-F bond length is 1.84 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.50 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three K¹⁺ atoms.
