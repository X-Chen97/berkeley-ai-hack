LiBGeO₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅4 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All B-O bond lengths are 1.48 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. All Ge-O bond lengths are 1.78 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
