LiNaSO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal P31c space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.78 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.09 Å. There are three inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.49 Å) and one longer (1.52 Å) S-O bond length. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.49 Å) and three longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. In the third S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All S-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three equivalent Na¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Na¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
