LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.05 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.73 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 45-63°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
