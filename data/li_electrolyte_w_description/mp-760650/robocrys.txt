Li₃Bi(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-77°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.20 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 71°. There are two shorter (2.05 Å) and two longer (2.07 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.57 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 41-74°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃P tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
