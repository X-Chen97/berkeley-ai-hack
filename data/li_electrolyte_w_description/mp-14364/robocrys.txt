Cs₂LiAsO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmc2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Cs¹⁺ sites. In the first Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.10-3.66 Å. In the second Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.11-3.24 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.10 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.73 Å) and two longer (1.74 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to three Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted L-shaped geometry to four Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted L-shaped geometry to four Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom.
