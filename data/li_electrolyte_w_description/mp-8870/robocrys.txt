LiMgAsO₄ is Spinel-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-63°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.28 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one AsO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-63°. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.22 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-60°. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.71-1.74 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Mg²⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂MgAs trigonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom.
