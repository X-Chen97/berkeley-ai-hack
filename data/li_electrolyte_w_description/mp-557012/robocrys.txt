Li₃Sc(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent ScO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one ScO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 68-77°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.14 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.03 Å) and two longer (2.13 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sc³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.14 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.38 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂ScB tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
