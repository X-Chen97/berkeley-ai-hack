Cs₂Li₂SiO₄ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Cs¹⁺ sites. In the first Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.04-3.27 Å. In the second Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 2.87-3.49 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.00 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.19 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.67 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four Cs¹⁺, two Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to five Cs¹⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
