LiAlSiH₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.09 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.72-1.84 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.70 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂H₂ tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
