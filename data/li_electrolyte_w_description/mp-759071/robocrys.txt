LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.75 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.15-2.48 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 36-50°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 50°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.63 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
