In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.40 Å.
