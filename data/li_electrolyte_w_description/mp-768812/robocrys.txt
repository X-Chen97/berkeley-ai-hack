LiB₂BiO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-1.95 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.43 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.60 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.21-2.96 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
