Cs₄Li(Pb₂O₃)₂ is Pb (Zr_0.50 Ti_0.48) O_3-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are two inequivalent Cs sites. In the first Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.14-3.38 Å. In the second Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one Li and six O atoms. The Cs-Li bond length is 3.06 Å. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.04-3.43 Å. Li is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two equivalent Cs, two equivalent Pb, and one O atom. Both Li-Pb bond lengths are 3.08 Å. The Li-O bond length is 1.82 Å. There are two inequivalent Pb sites. In the first Pb site, Pb is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.29 Å. In the second Pb site, Pb is bonded to one Li and three O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing PbLiO₃ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.24-2.27 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to four Cs and two Pb atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge, corner, and face-sharing OCs₄Pb₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-58°. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs, one Li, and two equivalent Pb atoms. In the third O site, O is bonded to four Cs and two equivalent Pb atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and face-sharing OCs₄Pb₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-69°. In the fourth O site, O is bonded to four Cs and two Pb atoms to form a mixture of edge, corner, and face-sharing OCs₄Pb₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-69°.
