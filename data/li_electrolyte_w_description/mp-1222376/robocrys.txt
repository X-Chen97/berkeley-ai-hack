LiZnBO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cc space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with five equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.87-2.17 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with five equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.04 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.41 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂ZnB tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Zn²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiZn₂B tetrahedra.
