LiAl(Si₂O₅)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.75 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.62 Å) and two longer (1.63 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.62 Å) and two longer (1.63 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms.
