K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.95-3.41 Å. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.67-3.41 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form distorted KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₃F tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₃F tetrahedra. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.67-2.79 Å. There is one shorter (2.62 Å) and one longer (2.75 Å) K-F bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form LiO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.07 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.85 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.53 Å. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.48 Å) and one longer (1.49 Å) S-O bond length. The S-F bond length is 1.80 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to three K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom.
