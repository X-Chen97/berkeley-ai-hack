LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅4 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.00 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.45 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SnO₄ tetrahedra. All P-O bond lengths are 1.56 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
