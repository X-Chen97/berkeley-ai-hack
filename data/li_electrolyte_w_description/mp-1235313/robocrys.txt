LiSrAlO₃ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/mmm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.85 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sr-O bond lengths are 2.61 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are four shorter (1.85 Å) and two longer (2.51 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four equivalent Sr²⁺ and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing OSr₄Al₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted.
