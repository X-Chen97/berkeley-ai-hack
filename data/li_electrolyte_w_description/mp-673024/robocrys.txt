LiSn₄(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R3c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.60-2.86 Å. There are two inequivalent Sn²⁺ sites. In the first Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.14 Å) and two longer (2.16 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. In the second Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.13 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.55 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
