Li₂H₄(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pccn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.05 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.72 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.02 Å) and one longer (1.63 Å) H-O bond length. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.44 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) S-O bond lengths. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.45-1.58 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
