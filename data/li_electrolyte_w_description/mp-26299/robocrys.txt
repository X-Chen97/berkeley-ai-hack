LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.15 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.26 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.59 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
