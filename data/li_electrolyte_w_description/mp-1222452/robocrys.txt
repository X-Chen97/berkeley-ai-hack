LiBi₃O₄Cl₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Amm2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.06 Å. There are three inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.25 Å. There are two shorter (3.39 Å) and two longer (3.46 Å) Bi-Cl bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.26 Å. There are two shorter (3.28 Å) and two longer (3.35 Å) Bi-Cl bond lengths. In the third Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. There are two shorter (3.26 Å) and two longer (3.32 Å) Bi-Cl bond lengths. O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three Bi³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLiBi₃ tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent Cl¹⁻ sites. In the first Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms.
