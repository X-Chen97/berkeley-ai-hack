LiGaSi₂O₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.39 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.15 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 35-59°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.66 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 42-60°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.67 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
