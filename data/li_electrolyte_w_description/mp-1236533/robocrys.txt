K₂LiH₂(SeO₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. K is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to one H and seven O atoms. The K-H bond length is 2.88 Å. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.74-3.13 Å. Li is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (2.02 Å) and two longer (2.03 Å) Li-O bond lengths. H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one K and one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. Se is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.70-2.24 Å. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K, one Li, one H, and one Se atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K, one Li, and one Se atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent K and one Se atom.
