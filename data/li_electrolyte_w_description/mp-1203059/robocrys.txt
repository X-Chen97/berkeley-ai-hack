LiAs₃H₂O₉ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent AsO₆ octahedra, corners with four AsO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 51-56°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.68 Å. There are three inequivalent As⁵⁺ sites. In the first As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AsO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-64°. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.65-1.74 Å. In the second As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one AsO₆ octahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 57°. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.65-1.73 Å. In the third As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₆ octahedra that share corners with four AsO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and  an edgeedge with one AsO₆ octahedra.
