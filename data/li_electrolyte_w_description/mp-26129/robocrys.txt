LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.20 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.87 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.65 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.60 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
