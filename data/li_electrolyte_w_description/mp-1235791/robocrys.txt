LiTm₂(OCl)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4mm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Tm²⁺, four equivalent O²⁻, and one Cl¹⁻ atom. The Li-Tm bond length is 2.56 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. The Li-Cl bond length is 2.22 Å. Tm²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent O²⁻, and five Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Tm-O bond lengths are 2.77 Å. There is one shorter (2.72 Å) and four longer (2.85 Å) Tm-Cl bond lengths. Tm³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Tm-O bond lengths are 2.15 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Tm²⁺, and two equivalent Tm³⁺ atoms. There are two inequivalent Cl¹⁻ sites. In the first Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Tm²⁺ atom. In the second Cl¹⁻ site, Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent Tm²⁺ atoms.
