KLi₃Si₁₂(SnO₁₅)₂ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6/mcc space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 12-coordinate geometry to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All K-O bond lengths are 3.10 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.95 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.06 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SnO₆ octahedra and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 39°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.64 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one K¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
