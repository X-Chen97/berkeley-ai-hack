Li₂SnTeO₆ is Ilmenite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnn2 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one TeO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-62°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.39 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.39 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent TeO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent TeO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 50°. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.14 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₆ pentagonal pyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 50°. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.98 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
