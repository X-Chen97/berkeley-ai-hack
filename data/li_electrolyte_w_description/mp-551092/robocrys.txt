KLiZnO₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.86-3.04 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.13 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one ZnO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.16 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to five equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and two equivalent Zn²⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, three equivalent Li¹⁺, and two equivalent Zn²⁺ atoms.
