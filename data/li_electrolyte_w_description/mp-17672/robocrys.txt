LiBaB₉O₁₅ crystallizes in the trigonal R3c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.89 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.91-3.07 Å. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.35 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with two equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and two longer (1.47 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.35 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ba²⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ba²⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ba²⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ba²⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms.
