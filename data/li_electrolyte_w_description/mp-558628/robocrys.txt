KLi₂BO₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.64 Å) and two longer (2.79 Å) K-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-2.08 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.41 Å) B-O bond length. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, four equivalent Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
