Li₆KBiO₆ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 24-coordinate geometry to twelve equivalent Li¹⁺ and twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All K-Li bond lengths are 3.01 Å. There are six shorter (3.04 Å) and six longer (3.09 Å) K-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent K¹⁺ and four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with twelve equivalent LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ octahedra, edges with six equivalent LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids, and faces with three equivalent LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 51°. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids and edges with six equivalent LiK₂O₄ trigonal pyramids. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.14 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, four equivalent Li¹⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom.
