Rb₄Li(Se₂O₇)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are two inequivalent Rb sites. In the first Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.94-3.23 Å. In the second Rb site, Rb is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.96-3.33 Å. Li is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O atoms. There are two shorter (1.89 Å) and one longer (1.95 Å) Li-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Se sites. In the first Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form corner-sharing SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.68-1.94 Å. In the second Se site, Se is bonded to four O atoms to form corner-sharing SeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.85 Å. There are eight inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Rb, one Li, and one Se atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Rb and one Se atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Rb and one Se atom. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Se atoms. In the eighth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li and two equivalent Se atoms.
