Li₇La₃Sn₂O₁₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal I4₁/acd space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 48°. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.92 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one SnO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 10-75°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.16 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.53 Å. There are two inequivalent La³⁺ sites. In the first La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.55 Å) and four longer (2.65 Å) La-O bond lengths. In the second La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.47-2.67 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.10 Å) and four longer (2.12 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, two La³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, two La³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom.
