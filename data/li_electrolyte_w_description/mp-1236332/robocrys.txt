LiAl₂Pb₂H₄(O₂F₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent F atoms. Both Li-F bond lengths are 1.87 Å. Al is bonded to three O and three F atoms to form edge-sharing AlO₃F₃ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.91 Å) and one longer (1.94 Å) Al-O bond length. There are a spread of Al-F bond distances ranging from 1.84-1.86 Å. Pb is bonded in a distorted pentagonal planar geometry to two equivalent O and three F atoms. Both Pb-O bond lengths are 2.55 Å. There are a spread of Pb-F bond distances ranging from 2.57-2.69 Å. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Al and one H atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Al, two equivalent Pb, and one H atom. There are three inequivalent F sites. In the first F site, F is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Al and one Pb atom. In the second F site, F is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Al and one Pb atom. In the third F site, F is bonded in a water-like geometry to one Li, one Al, and one Pb atom.
