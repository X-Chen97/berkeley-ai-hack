Li₂Bi₂(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.25 Å. Bi²⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.48 Å. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.53 Å. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.47 Å) and two longer (1.53 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Bi²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
