Li₂BeSiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BeO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (1.95 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.91 Å) and two longer (2.04 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Be²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.63 Å) and two longer (1.65 Å) Be-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.62 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi trigonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi trigonal pyramids.
