RbLiSO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Rb¹⁺ sites. In the first Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.86-3.51 Å. In the second Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.87-3.30 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-1.93 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-1.93 Å.
