LiGaSi₂O₆ is Esseneite structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.54 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.15 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-60°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.66 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
