Li₂Sn₂(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one SnO₅ trigonal bipyramid, and  an edgeedge with one SnO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.01 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with five SO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.64 Å. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SnO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SnO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.49 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
