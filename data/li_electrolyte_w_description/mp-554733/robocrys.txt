Li₄Al₃Ge₃O₁₂Br crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one Br¹⁻ atom to form LiBrO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.03 Å. The Li-Br bond length is 2.74 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.77 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiBrO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Ge-O bond lengths are 1.77 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. Br¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
