LiAsH₂OF₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Imma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₂F₄ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra and corners with four equivalent AsF₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 38-59°. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.17 Å. All Li-F bond lengths are 2.07 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to six F¹⁻ atoms to form AsF₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 38°. There are two shorter (1.77 Å) and four longer (1.78 Å) As-F bond lengths. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent H¹⁺ atoms. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one As⁵⁺ atom.
