LiU₂TmS₃O₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two S²⁻ and four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.61 Å) and one longer (2.66 Å) Li-S bond length. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.90 Å. There are two inequivalent U³⁺ sites. In the first U³⁺ site, U³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to four equivalent S²⁻ and four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.90 Å) and three longer (2.92 Å) U-S bond lengths. There are two shorter (2.44 Å) and two longer (2.45 Å) U-O bond lengths. In the second U³⁺ site, U³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to four equivalent S²⁻ and four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.87 Å) and three longer (2.88 Å) U-S bond lengths. There are two shorter (2.48 Å) and two longer (2.51 Å) U-O bond lengths. Tm³⁺ is bonded to six S²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing TmS₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 5°. There are a spread of Tm-S bond distances ranging from 2.66-2.70 Å. There are three inequivalent S²⁻ sites. In the first S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent U³⁺, and one Tm³⁺ atom. In the second S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent U³⁺, and one Tm³⁺ atom. In the third S²⁻ site, S²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four equivalent Tm³⁺ atoms. O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four U³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge, corner, and face-sharing OLi₂U₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 1°.
