Li₂Sn(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.11 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent SnO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-2.10 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.33-1.43 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms.
