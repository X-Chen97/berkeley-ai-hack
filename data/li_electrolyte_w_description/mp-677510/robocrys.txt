LiMgSO₄F crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form distorted LiO₃F trigonal pyramids that share  a cornercorner with one MgO₄F₂ octahedra and  an edgeedge with one MgO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 62°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.28 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.97 Å. There are two inequivalent Mg²⁺ sites. In the first Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form MgO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₃F trigonal pyramids and edges with two equivalent LiO₃F trigonal pyramids. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.27 Å) Mg-O bond lengths. Both Mg-F bond lengths are 2.02 Å. In the second Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. Both Mg-O bond lengths are 2.00 Å. Both Mg-F bond lengths are 1.94 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.48 Å) S-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Mg²⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Mg²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Mg²⁺ atoms.
