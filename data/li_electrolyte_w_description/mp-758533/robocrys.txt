Li₃Sb(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.11 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.12 Å) and four longer (2.23 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are four shorter (2.31 Å) and two longer (2.33 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 34-62°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.59 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
