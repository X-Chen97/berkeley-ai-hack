LiSn(PO₃)₃ crystallizes in the hexagonal P̅6c2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.27 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.55 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 49-56°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.61 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
