(LiSO₄)₂N₂ is Low Tridymite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. The structure consists of four N₂ clusters inside a LiSO₄ framework. In each N₂ cluster, N¹⁺ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the LiSO₄ framework, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.98 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.49 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
