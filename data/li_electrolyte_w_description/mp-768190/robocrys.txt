Li₃MgCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.51 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.69 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.31 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.29-1.31 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-60°. There are three shorter (1.55 Å) and one longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLi₃C tetrahedra.
