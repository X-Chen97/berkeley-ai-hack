Li₄CaB₂O₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnnm space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 18-80°. There are two shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, edges with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.24 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form CaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are four shorter (2.35 Å) and two longer (2.45 Å) Ca-O bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.40 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₄B trigonal bipyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₂Ca₂B trigonal bipyramids.
