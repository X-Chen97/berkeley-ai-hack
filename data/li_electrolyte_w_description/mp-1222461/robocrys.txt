LiBi₃(O₂I)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Amm2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.11 Å. There are three inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four I¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. There are two shorter (3.60 Å) and two longer (3.66 Å) Bi-I bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four I¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.29 Å. There are two shorter (3.56 Å) and two longer (3.62 Å) Bi-I bond lengths. In the third Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and four I¹⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. There are two shorter (3.54 Å) and two longer (3.60 Å) Bi-I bond lengths. O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and three Bi³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiBi₃ tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent I¹⁻ sites. In the first I¹⁻ site, I¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second I¹⁻ site, I¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six Bi³⁺ atoms.
