Li₃Bi₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two BiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 65-74°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.12 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.31 Å) and three longer (2.45 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.26 Å) and three longer (2.51 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four BiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 20-60°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.59 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂BiP tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
