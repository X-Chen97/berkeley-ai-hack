LiBaPrTeO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.85 Å. Pr³⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. All Pr-O bond lengths are 2.85 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent PrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Te-O bond lengths are 1.94 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ba²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
