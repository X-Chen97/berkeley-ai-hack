LiBa₃(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R3m space group. Li is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.76 Å. There are three inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.86-3.30 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one O atom. The Ba-O bond length is 2.44 Å. In the third Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O atoms. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.66 Å. There are two inequivalent As sites. In the first As site, As is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There is one shorter (1.72 Å) and three longer (1.74 Å) As-O bond lengths. In the second As site, As is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There are three shorter (1.82 Å) and one longer (1.93 Å) As-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Ba and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a linear geometry to one Ba and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two Ba and one As atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li, two equivalent Ba, and one As atom.
