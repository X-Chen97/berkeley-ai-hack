LiAlSiH₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.58 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.72-1.83 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.71 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.02 Å) and one longer (1.62 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms to form distorted OLi₂H₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent OLi₂H₂ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent OLiAlSiH trigonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiAlSiH trigonal pyramids. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
