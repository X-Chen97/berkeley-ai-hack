Li₄Ga₃Si₃O₁₂Cl crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one Cl¹⁻ atom to form LiClO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.03 Å. The Li-Cl bond length is 2.56 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Ga-O bond lengths are 1.85 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiClO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.65 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
