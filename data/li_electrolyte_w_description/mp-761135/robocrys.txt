Li₃Sb₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 69-70°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.19 Å. There are two inequivalent Sb³⁺ sites. In the first Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.10 Å) and three longer (2.61 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. In the second Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.25 Å) and three longer (2.42 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SbO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 22-58°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SbP tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
