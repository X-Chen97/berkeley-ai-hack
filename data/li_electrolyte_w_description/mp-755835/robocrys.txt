LiB₂BiO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.84-1.99 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.42-1.56 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.51 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.25-2.91 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two B³⁺ and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent B³⁺ and one Bi³⁺ atom.
