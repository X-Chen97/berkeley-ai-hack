La₂LiSbO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-33°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.21 Å. La³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.89 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-33°. There are four shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiLa₂Sb tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
