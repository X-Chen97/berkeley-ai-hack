LiB₂BiO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 31-62°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.08 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.38 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.37 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.51 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
