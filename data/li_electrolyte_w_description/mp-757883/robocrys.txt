LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.99 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.99 Å) and one longer (2.09 Å) Li-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.67 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are three shorter (1.65 Å) and one longer (1.68 Å) Si-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.71 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.18 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
