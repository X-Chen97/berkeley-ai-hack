LiSrPrTeO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic Pc space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 23-32°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.24 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.52-2.82 Å. Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.43-2.84 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 23-32°. There are three shorter (1.95 Å) and three longer (1.96 Å) Te-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
