LiH₂O₅Br crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.02 Å) and two longer (2.16 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O¹⁻ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. The H-O bond length is 1.73 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are two inequivalent O¹⁻ sites. In the first O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one O¹⁻, and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-O bond length is 1.47 Å. The O-Br bond length is 2.26 Å. In the second O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one O¹⁻ atom. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-Br bond length is 2.10 Å. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Br⁵⁺ atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.66 Å.
