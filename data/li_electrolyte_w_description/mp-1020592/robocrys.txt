Li₂Sr₄Si₄N₈O crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/mnc space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four equivalent N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom. All Li-N bond lengths are 2.25 Å. The Li-O bond length is 1.78 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to seven N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom. There are a spread of Sr-N bond distances ranging from 2.63-3.02 Å. The Sr-O bond length is 2.54 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four N³⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SiN₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.74 Å) and one longer (1.76 Å) Si-N bond length. There are two inequivalent N³⁻ sites. In the first N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, three equivalent Sr²⁺, and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Sr²⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted octahedral geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four equivalent Sr²⁺ atoms.
