Li₂EuSiO₄ is Chalcostibite-derived structured and crystallizes in the trigonal P3_121 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.03 Å. Eu²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Eu-O bond distances ranging from 2.57-2.68 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.65 Å) and two longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Eu²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Eu²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
