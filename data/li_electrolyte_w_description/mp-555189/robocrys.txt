Rb₂LiCS₃(O₃F)₃(CF₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. The structure consists of eight CF₃ clusters inside a Rb₂LiCS₃(O₃F)₃ framework. In each CF₃ cluster, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three F¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.35 Å) and two longer (1.36 Å) C-F bond lengths. There are three inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C⁴⁺ atom. In the Rb₂LiCS₃(O₃F)₃ framework, there are two inequivalent Rb¹⁺ sites. In the first Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms.

There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.90-3.28 Å. The Rb-F bond length is 3.27 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.00 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three F¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.35 Å) and one longer (1.36 Å) C-F bond length. There are three inequivalent S⁴⁺ sites. In the first S⁴⁺ site, S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.47 Å) S-O bond length. In the second S⁴⁺ site, S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.47 Å) S-O bond length.
