Li₂MgSi₅O₁₂ is Esseneite-like structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I4₁/acd space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.40 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.17 Å) and four longer (2.36 Å) Mg-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.78-1.81 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 46°. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.65 Å. In the third Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 44-46°. There are two shorter (1.64 Å) and two longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and two Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and two Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two Si⁴⁺ atoms.
