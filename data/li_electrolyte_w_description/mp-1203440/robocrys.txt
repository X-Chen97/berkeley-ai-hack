LiZnSO₄F crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.10 Å) and two longer (2.24 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Both Li-F bond lengths are 2.04 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.50 Å. There is one shorter (2.03 Å) and one longer (2.18 Å) Zn-F bond length. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-51°. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.50 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Zn²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Zn²⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing FLi₂Zn₂ trigonal pyramids.
