LiSc₂Al₂(CO)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Sc¹⁺ and two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both Li-Sc bond lengths are 1.88 Å. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.65 Å. Sc¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both Sc-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. Sc²⁺ is bonded to six equivalent C³⁻ atoms to form ScC₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlC₃O tetrahedra, edges with six equivalent ScC₆ octahedra, and edges with six equivalent AlC₃O tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.33 Å) and four longer (2.59 Å) Sc-C bond lengths. Al³⁺ is bonded to three equivalent C³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom to form AlC₃O tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScC₆ octahedra, corners with six equivalent AlC₃O tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent ScC₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 17-20°. There is one shorter (2.03 Å) and two longer (2.21 Å) Al-C bond lengths. The Al-O bond length is 1.84 Å. C³⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Sc²⁺ and three equivalent Al³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing CSc₃Al₃ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc¹⁺, and one Al³⁺ atom.
