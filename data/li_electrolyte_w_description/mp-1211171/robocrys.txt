LiEr(SO₄)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P̅4n2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.87 Å. Er³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.38 Å) and four longer (2.40 Å) Er-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.52 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Er³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Er³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
