Li₂MgGeO₄ is Stannite-like structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pmn2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.98 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.97 Å) and one longer (1.98 Å) Mg-O bond length. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.76 Å) and two longer (1.77 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra.
