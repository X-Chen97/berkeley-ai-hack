NaLi₂PO₄ is Aluminum carbonitride-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.30-2.82 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.02 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All P-O bond lengths are 1.56 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing ONaLi₂P trigonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
