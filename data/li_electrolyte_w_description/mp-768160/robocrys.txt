Li₂CBiPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.66 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.26 Å) and two longer (1.32 Å) C-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.30-2.76 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.57 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
