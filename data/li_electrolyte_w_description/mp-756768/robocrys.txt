Li₃BeCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BeO₅ trigonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.03 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.65 Å. Be²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BeO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.92 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.29 Å) and one longer (1.30 Å) C-O bond length. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BeO₅ trigonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.53 Å) and one longer (1.54 Å) P-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃C tetrahedra that share corners with five OLi₃C tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one OLi₂BeC tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₃C tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₂BeC tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
