LiBa₂O₆I is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic Fm̅3m space group. Li is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent IO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.24 Å. Ba is bonded to twelve equivalent O atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent IO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.94 Å. O is bonded to one Li, four equivalent Ba, and one I atom to form a mixture of distorted face, edge, and corner-sharing OBa₄LiI octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-60°. The O-I bond length is 1.91 Å. I is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form IO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted.
