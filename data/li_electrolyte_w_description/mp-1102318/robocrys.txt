LiCdBO₃ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one CdO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.07 Å. Cd²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Cd-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.59 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.41 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
