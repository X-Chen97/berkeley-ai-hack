LiPr₂(O₂Br)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two O and three Br atoms. There is one shorter (2.00 Å) and one longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond length. There are a spread of Li-Br bond distances ranging from 2.66-3.23 Å. There are two inequivalent Pr sites. In the first Pr site, Pr is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to six O and three Br atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.49 Å. There are a spread of Pr-Br bond distances ranging from 3.17-3.27 Å. In the second Pr site, Pr is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to five O and two Br atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.55 Å. There is one shorter (3.11 Å) and one longer (3.21 Å) Pr-Br bond length. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li and two Pr atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Pr and one O atom. The O-O bond length is 1.47 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li and three Pr atoms. In the fourth O site, O is bonded to three Pr and one O atom to form distorted corner-sharing OPr₃O tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent Br sites. In the first Br site, Br is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li and two Pr atoms. In the second Br site, Br is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li and three Pr atoms.
