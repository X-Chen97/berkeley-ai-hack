Li₂Zn(OCl₂)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li sites. In the first Li site, Li is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two O and two Cl atoms. There is one shorter (1.92 Å) and one longer (1.96 Å) Li-O bond length. There is one shorter (2.45 Å) and one longer (2.57 Å) Li-Cl bond length. In the second Li site, Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two O and three Cl atoms. There is one shorter (1.94 Å) and one longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond length. There are a spread of Li-Cl bond distances ranging from 2.43-2.92 Å. Zn is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four Cl atoms. There are a spread of Zn-Cl bond distances ranging from 2.24-2.45 Å. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Li atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li and one Cl atom. The O-Cl bond length is 1.65 Å. There are four inequivalent Cl sites. In the first Cl site, Cl is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Zn and one O atom. In the second Cl site, Cl is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li and one Zn atom. In the third Cl site, Cl is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li and one Zn atom. In the fourth Cl site, Cl is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li and one Zn atom.
