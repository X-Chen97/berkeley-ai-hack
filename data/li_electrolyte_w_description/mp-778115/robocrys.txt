Li₂BBiO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.45 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.06 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.43 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.47 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
