K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.84 Å) and two longer (3.24 Å) K-O bond lengths. There is one shorter (2.89 Å) and two longer (3.38 Å) K-F bond lengths. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.82-3.21 Å. There is one shorter (2.55 Å) and two longer (3.28 Å) K-F bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.74 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.53 Å. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. The S-F bond length is 1.74 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S³⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom.
