K₂LiH₂(SeO₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K sites. In the first K site, K is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.74-2.95 Å. In the second K site, K is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one H and five O atoms. The K-H bond length is 2.62 Å. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.65-2.98 Å. Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.02 Å. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O atoms. There is one shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.60 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one K and one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are two inequivalent Se sites. In the first Se site, Se is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.71-1.78 Å. In the second Se site, Se is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O atoms. There is one shorter (1.72 Å) and one longer (1.83 Å) Se-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two K, one H, and one Se atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K and one Se atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K and one Se atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two K, one Li, and one Se atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one K, one Li, one H, and one Se atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two K, one Li, and one H atom.
