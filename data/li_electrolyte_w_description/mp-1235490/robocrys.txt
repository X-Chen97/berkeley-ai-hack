Rb₂LiPu(OCl₂)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted pentagonal planar geometry to one O²⁻ and four equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. The Rb-O bond length is 2.95 Å. There are two shorter (3.29 Å) and two longer (3.32 Å) Rb-Cl bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. All Li-Cl bond lengths are 2.45 Å. Pu⁵⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. Both Pu-O bond lengths are 1.82 Å. All Pu-Cl bond lengths are 2.84 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Rb¹⁺ and one Pu⁵⁺ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one Pu⁵⁺ atom.
