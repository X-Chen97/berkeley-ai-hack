LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.54 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.68 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.68 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
