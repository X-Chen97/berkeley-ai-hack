LiYGeO₄ is Spinel-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent YO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent YO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-63°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.27 Å. Y³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form YO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent YO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-63°. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.25-2.36 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent YO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one YO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-60°. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.74-1.81 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Y³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Y³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Y³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂YGe trigonal pyramids.
