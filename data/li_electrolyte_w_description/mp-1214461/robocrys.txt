LiBa₄(BiO₄)₃ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic Im̅3m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.26 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are six shorter (3.05 Å) and six longer (3.06 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are two shorter (2.06 Å) and four longer (2.16 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent Ba²⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four equivalent Ba²⁺ and two equivalent Bi⁵⁺ atoms.
