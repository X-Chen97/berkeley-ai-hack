Li₆B₄Sn₂SO₁₆ crystallizes in the cubic Fd̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 61-78°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.40 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.38 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share edges with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. All S-O bond lengths are 1.50 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom to form distorted edge-sharing OLi₃S trigonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom.
