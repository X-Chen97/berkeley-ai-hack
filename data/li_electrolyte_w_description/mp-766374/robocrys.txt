LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 59-78°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.08 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 50-56°. There are three shorter (1.65 Å) and one longer (1.67 Å) Si-O bond length. There are three inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.34 Å) and three longer (2.49 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.27 Å) and three longer (2.64 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. In the third Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.19 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
