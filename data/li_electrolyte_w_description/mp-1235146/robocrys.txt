LiY₃(PO₄)₃ is Zircon-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.90 Å) and four longer (2.97 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Y³⁺ sites. In the first Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with four YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.35-2.54 Å. In the second Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with four equivalent YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.34 Å) and four longer (2.53 Å) Y-O bond lengths. P⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids and edges with two equivalent YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids. All P-O bond lengths are 1.55 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids and edges with two equivalent YO₈ hexagonal bipyramids. All P-O bond lengths are 1.55 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Y³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Y³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Y³⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom.
