LiAlSiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.12 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.77-1.79 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.64 Å) and two longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
