Li(H₂O)₂(BH)₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of twenty-four BH clusters and two Li(H₂O)₂ clusters. In each BH cluster, B is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one H atom. The B-H bond length is 1.20 Å. H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one B atom. In each Li(H₂O)₂ cluster, Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. There is one shorter (2.00 Å) and two longer (2.16 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent H atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li and two equivalent H atoms.
