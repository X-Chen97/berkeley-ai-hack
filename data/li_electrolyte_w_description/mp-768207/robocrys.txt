Li₂CSbPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.32 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.59 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.27 Å) and two longer (1.32 Å) C-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.48 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra.
