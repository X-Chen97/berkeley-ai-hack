BaLaLiTeO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent LaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.10 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent LaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.86 Å. La³⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent LaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. All La-O bond lengths are 2.86 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent LaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Te-O bond lengths are 1.94 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ba²⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
