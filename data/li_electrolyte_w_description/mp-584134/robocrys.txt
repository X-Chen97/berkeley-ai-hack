LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.65 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.63 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 39-60°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 49-63°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.63 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites.
