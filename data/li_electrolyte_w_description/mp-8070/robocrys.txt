Li₂BeSiO₄ is beta beryllia-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic Pc space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-1.98 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.99 Å. Be²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.66 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.63 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂BeSi tetrahedra.
