LiSrBO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with five equivalent SrO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, edges with three equivalent SrO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.15 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SrO₇ pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent SrO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, corners with five equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, edges with four equivalent SrO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, and edges with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.51-2.70 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Sr²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
