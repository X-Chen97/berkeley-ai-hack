LiBa₂TbSnO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Ba²⁺ and three O²⁻ atoms. The Li-Ba bond length is 2.64 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.91 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba²⁺ sites. In the first Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.68-3.13 Å. In the second Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded in a distorted q6 geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.93-3.01 Å. Tb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted TbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-6°. There are a spread of Tb-O bond distances ranging from 2.15-2.44 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-6°. There are three shorter (2.07 Å) and three longer (2.18 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to three Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom.
