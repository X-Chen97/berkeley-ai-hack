Rb₂LiPu(OCl₂)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted body-centered cubic geometry to eight equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.43-3.69 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted octahedral geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.03 Å. All Li-Cl bond lengths are 2.76 Å. Pu⁵⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. Both Pu-O bond lengths are 1.83 Å. All Pu-Cl bond lengths are 2.75 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Pu⁵⁺ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one Pu⁵⁺ atom.
