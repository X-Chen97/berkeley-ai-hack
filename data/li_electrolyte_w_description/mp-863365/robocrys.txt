Li₂Sn(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.48 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.61 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 39-65°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 57°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.61 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
