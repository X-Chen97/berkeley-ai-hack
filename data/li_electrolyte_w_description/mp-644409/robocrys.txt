LiAl(PO₄)(OH) crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.15 Å. There are two inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.94 Å. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.87-1.94 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 33-52°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.56 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Al³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
