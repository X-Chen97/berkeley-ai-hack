LiGa(SeO₃)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅42d space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.03 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Ga³⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.03 Å. Se⁴⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Se-O bond distances ranging from 1.72-1.75 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Se⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Se⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ga³⁺ and one Se⁴⁺ atom.
