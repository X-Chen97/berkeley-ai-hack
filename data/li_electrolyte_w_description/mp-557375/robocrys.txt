LiNaCO₃ crystallizes in the hexagonal P̅6 space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.42 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.08 Å. There are three inequivalent C⁴⁺ sites. In the first C⁴⁺ site, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. In the second C⁴⁺ site, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. In the third C⁴⁺ site, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.31 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom.
