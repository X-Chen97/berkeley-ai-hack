LiAlSi₂O₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.99 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.76 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.63 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
