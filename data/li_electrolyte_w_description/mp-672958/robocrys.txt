LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.02 Å) and two longer (2.19 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.25-2.30 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-51°. There are two shorter (1.51 Å) and two longer (1.60 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 48°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.62 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
