LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-2.55 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted pentagonal planar geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.26-2.59 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.61 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
