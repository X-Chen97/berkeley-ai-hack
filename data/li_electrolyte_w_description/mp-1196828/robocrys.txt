NaLiMgPO₄F crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.64 Å. There is one shorter (2.52 Å) and one longer (2.67 Å) Na-F bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form distorted LiO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 67-81°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.05 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.94 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form MgO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₃F tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent MgO₄F₂ octahedra.
