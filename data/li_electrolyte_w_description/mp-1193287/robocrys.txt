Li₂Sc(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.23 Å. Sc is bonded to six O atoms to form ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.18 Å. P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 20-54°. There are three shorter (1.55 Å) and one longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Sc, and one P atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li, one Sc, and one P atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a T-shaped geometry to one Li, one Sc, and one P atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent Li and one P atom.
