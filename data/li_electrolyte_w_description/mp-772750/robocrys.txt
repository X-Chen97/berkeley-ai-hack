Li₃MgCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.46 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.55 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.51 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.53 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids.
