LiNd₂HO₃ is (La,Ba)CuO4-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent H¹⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiH₂O₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. Both Li-H bond lengths are 1.75 Å. There are two shorter (1.86 Å) and two longer (2.24 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Nd³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to two equivalent H¹⁻ and seven O²⁻ atoms. Both Nd-H bond lengths are 2.54 Å. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-2.61 Å. H¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four equivalent Nd³⁺ atoms. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four equivalent Nd³⁺ atoms to form distorted OLi₂Nd₄ octahedra that share corners with fourteen OLi₂Nd₄ octahedra, edges with two equivalent OLi₂Nd₄ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent OLiNd₅ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-52°. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺ and five equivalent Nd³⁺ atoms to form distorted OLiNd₅ octahedra that share corners with eleven OLi₂Nd₄ octahedra, edges with eight equivalent OLiNd₅ octahedra, and faces with two equivalent OLi₂Nd₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-52°.
