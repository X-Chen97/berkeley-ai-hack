LiZnAsO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.08 Å. Zn is bonded to four O atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.99 Å. As is bonded to four O atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.72 Å) and one longer (1.73 Å) As-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Zn and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Zn, and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Zn, and one As atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Zn, and one As atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li atom.
