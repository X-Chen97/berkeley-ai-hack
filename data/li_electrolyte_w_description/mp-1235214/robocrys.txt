LiCd₂Al₄O₈ crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. Li is bonded to four equivalent Al and four equivalent O atoms to form LiAl₄O₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent CdO₄ tetrahedra and corners with twelve equivalent OAl₃Cd trigonal pyramids. All Li-Al bond lengths are 2.08 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. There are two inequivalent Cd sites. In the first Cd site, Cd is bonded to four equivalent O atoms to form CdO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiAl₄O₄ tetrahedra. All Cd-O bond lengths are 2.19 Å. In the second Cd site, Cd is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent O atoms. All Cd-O bond lengths are 2.26 Å. Al is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one Li and six O atoms. There are three shorter (1.92 Å) and three longer (2.18 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to one Cd and three equivalent Al atoms to form distorted OAl₃Cd trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiAl₄O₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent OAl₃Cd trigonal pyramids, and edges with three equivalent OAl₃Cd trigonal pyramids. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, one Cd, and three equivalent Al atoms.
