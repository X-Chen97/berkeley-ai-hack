Li₂Ca₂Si₂O₇ is Hausmannite-derived structured and crystallizes in the hexagonal P6_122 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 58-64°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.13 Å. There are two inequivalent Ca²⁺ sites. In the first Ca²⁺ site, Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-2.42 Å. In the second Ca²⁺ site, Ca²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CaO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 29°. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.66 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one SiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one CaO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 57-78°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.71 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Ca²⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiCa₂Si trigonal pyramids. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Ca²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
