KLiAl₂Si₄(O₅F)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. K is bonded to twelve O atoms to form KO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent KO₁₂ cuboctahedra and edges with twelve equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 3.13-3.29 Å. Li is bonded to four equivalent O and two equivalent F atoms to form LiO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with six equivalent AlO₄F₂ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.21 Å. Both Li-F bond lengths are 2.10 Å. Al is bonded to four equivalent O and two equivalent F atoms to form AlO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with three equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra, and edges with three equivalent AlO₄F₂ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Al-O bond lengths. Both Al-F bond lengths are 1.99 Å. Si is bonded to four O atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄F₂ octahedra, corners with two equivalent AlO₄F₂ octahedra, corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent KO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 55-65°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.66-1.69 Å. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K and two equivalent Si atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded to one Li, two equivalent Al, and one Si atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiAl₂Si trigonal pyramids. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent K and two equivalent Si atoms. F is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li and two equivalent Al atoms.
