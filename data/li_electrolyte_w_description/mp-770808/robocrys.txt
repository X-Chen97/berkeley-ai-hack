LiB₂SbO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (2.22 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (2.21 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.43 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.42 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal pyramidal geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.25 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one B³⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom.
