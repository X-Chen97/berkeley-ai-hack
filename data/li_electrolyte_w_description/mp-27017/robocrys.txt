LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.00 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.96 Å) and three longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Sn²⁺ sites. In the first Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.21-2.25 Å. In the second Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.37 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with five LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.59 Å. There are eight inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the eighth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
