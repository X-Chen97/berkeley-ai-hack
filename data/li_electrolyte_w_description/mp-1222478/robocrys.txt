Li₃SO₃N is beta beryllia-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pmn2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form LiNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SNO₃ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiNO₃ tetrahedra. The Li-N bond length is 2.06 Å. There is one shorter (2.03 Å) and two longer (2.14 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form LiNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SNO₃ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiNO₃ tetrahedra. The Li-N bond length is 1.99 Å. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.03 Å. N³⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom to form distorted NLi₃S tetrahedra that share corners with twelve OLi₃S tetrahedra. The N-S bond length is 1.49 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form SNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with twelve LiNO₃ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.54 Å) and two longer (1.55 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom to form OLi₃S tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent NLi₃S tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent OLi₃S tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃S tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent NLi₃S tetrahedra and corners with eight OLi₃S tetrahedra.
