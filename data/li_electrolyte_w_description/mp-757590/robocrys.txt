LiSnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.33 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SnO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.52 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₄ trigonal pyramids and  an edgeedge with one SnO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
