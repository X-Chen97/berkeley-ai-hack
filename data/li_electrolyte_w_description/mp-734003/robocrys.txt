(Li₂(PO₃)₃)₂N₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group. The structure consists of eight N₂ clusters inside a Li₂(PO₃)₃ framework. In each N₂ cluster, N¹⁺ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the Li₂(PO₃)₃ framework, there are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.99 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.98 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.63 Å. In the third P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.62 Å. There are nine inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the eighth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the ninth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
