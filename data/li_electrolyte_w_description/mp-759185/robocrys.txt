LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.72 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.26-2.32 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 21-58°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.63 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
