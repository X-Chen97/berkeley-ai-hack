Li₂U₃(PO₅)₄ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with three PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one UO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.45 Å. There are two inequivalent U⁶⁺ sites. In the first U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.79-2.63 Å. In the second U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids. There are two shorter (1.82 Å) and four longer (2.31 Å) U-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ square pyramid and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.61 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent UO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
