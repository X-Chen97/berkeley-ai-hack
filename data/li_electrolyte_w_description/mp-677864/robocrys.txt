LiSn₂P₃O₁₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. The structure consists of two O₂ clusters inside a LiSn₂P₃O₁₁ framework. In each O₂ cluster, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the LiSn₂P₃O₁₁ framework, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.74 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one O²⁻ and two O¹⁻ atoms. The Sn-O bond length is 2.48 Å. There is one shorter (1.28 Å) and one longer (1.29 Å) Sn-O bond length. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 1.85-2.14 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one O¹⁻ and two O²⁻ atoms. The P-O bond length is 1.11 Å. There is one shorter (1.53 Å) and one longer (1.93 Å) P-O bond length. There are two inequivalent P⁴⁺ sites. In the first P⁴⁺ site, P⁴⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.57-1.97 Å. In the second P⁴⁺ site, P⁴⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one O¹⁻ and two O²⁻ atoms. The P-O bond length is 1.60 Å.
