LiBeAsO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.04 Å. Be is bonded to four O atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.66 Å. As is bonded to four O atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.70 Å) and three longer (1.72 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Be and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one As atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one As atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li atom.
