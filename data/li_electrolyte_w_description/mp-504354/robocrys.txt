LiBi(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (1.95 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.35-2.66 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.60 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
