Li₂GeTeO₆ is Ilmenite-derived structured and crystallizes in the trigonal R3 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.05 Å) and three longer (2.42 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.07 Å) and three longer (2.42 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₆ octahedra that share edges with three equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (1.91 Å) and three longer (1.96 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share edges with three equivalent GeO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (1.95 Å) and three longer (1.97 Å) Te-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Ge⁴⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Ge⁴⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
