Li₃ZnCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.29 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and one longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond length. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.22 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.14 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.29-1.31 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths.
