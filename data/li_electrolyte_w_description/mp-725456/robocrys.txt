Li₂Sn(OF₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li is bonded to two equivalent O and four F atoms to form LiO₂F₄ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnF₆ octahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 38-57°. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.14 Å. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.09 Å) Li-F bond lengths. Sn is bonded to six F atoms to form SnF₆ octahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 38-57°. There are four shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.03 Å) Sn-F bond lengths. O is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent Li atoms. There are two inequivalent F sites. In the first F site, F is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li and one Sn atom. In the second F site, F is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li and one Sn atom.
