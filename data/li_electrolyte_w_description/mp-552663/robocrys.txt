LiScAs₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.13 Å) and two longer (2.21 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sc³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.16 Å. As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one AsO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 27-55°. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.69-1.78 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sc³⁺ and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent As⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one As⁵⁺ atom.
