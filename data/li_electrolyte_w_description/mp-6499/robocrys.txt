LiBaBO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.23 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.73-3.29 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ba²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ba²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ba²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
