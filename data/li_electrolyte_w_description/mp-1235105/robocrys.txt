LiSc₂Al₂(CO)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Sc¹⁺ and two equivalent C³⁻ atoms. Both Li-Sc bond lengths are 1.86 Å. Both Li-C bond lengths are 1.93 Å. Sc¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent C³⁻ atoms. Both Sc-C bond lengths are 2.43 Å. Sc²⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlC₃O tetrahedra and edges with six equivalent ScO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.11 Å) and four longer (2.27 Å) Sc-O bond lengths. Al³⁺ is bonded to three equivalent C³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom to form AlC₃O tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScO₆ octahedra and corners with six equivalent AlC₃O tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 65-66°. There is one shorter (2.04 Å) and two longer (2.15 Å) Al-C bond lengths. The Al-O bond length is 1.82 Å. C³⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc¹⁺, and three equivalent Al³⁺ atoms. O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Sc²⁺ and one Al³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OSc₃Al tetrahedra.
