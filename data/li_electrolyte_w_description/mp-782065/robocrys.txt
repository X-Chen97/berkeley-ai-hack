LiPTeO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.04-2.64 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.54 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. Te⁴⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.87 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one P⁵⁺ and one Te⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Te⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one Te⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one Te⁴⁺ atom.
