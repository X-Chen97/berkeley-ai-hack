LiBa₃(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.96 Å. There are three inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.76-3.06 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.65-2.93 Å. In the third Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.67-3.09 Å. There are two inequivalent As sites. In the first As site, As is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.77-1.97 Å. In the second As site, As is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.72 Å) and two longer (1.74 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are eight inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, three Ba, and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two Ba and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three Ba and one As atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded to four Ba and one As atom to form distorted corner-sharing OBa₄As square pyramids. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three Ba and one As atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three Ba and one As atom. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Li, two Ba, and one As atom. In the eighth O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Li, two Ba, and one As atom.
