LiB₂SbO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 64°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.32 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.39 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.14 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one B³⁺ and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to one B³⁺ and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
