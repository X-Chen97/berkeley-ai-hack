LiScSi₂O₆ is Esseneite structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.76 Å. Sc³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent ScO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.02-2.25 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 36-60°. There is one shorter (1.62 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent ScO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 38-60°. There is one shorter (1.62 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sc³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sc³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
