LiKCO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.80-3.37 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.20 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.29-1.32 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom.
