LiH₂PO₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PHO₃ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.07 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to one H and three O²⁻ atoms to form distorted PHO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The P-H bond length is 1.41 Å. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.61 Å. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.52 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one P⁵⁺ atom. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one H atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one H atom.
