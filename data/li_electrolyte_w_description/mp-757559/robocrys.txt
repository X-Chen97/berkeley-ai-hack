LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.37 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.64 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
