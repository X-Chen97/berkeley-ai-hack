Li₂CdGeO₄ is beta beryllia-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pmn2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent CdO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.06 Å. Cd²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form CdO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.21 Å) and two longer (2.26 Å) Cd-O bond lengths. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent CdO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.78 Å) and one longer (1.80 Å) Ge-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂CdGe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂CdGe tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂CdGe tetrahedra.
