K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.85-3.27 Å. There is one shorter (2.55 Å) and one longer (2.64 Å) K-F bond length. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.89-3.01 Å. There is one shorter (2.59 Å) and one longer (2.63 Å) K-F bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. The Li-O bond length is 2.07 Å. Both Li-F bond lengths are 1.79 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.50 Å) and one longer (1.51 Å) S-O bond length. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three K¹⁺ and one S³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OK₃S tetrahedra. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom.
