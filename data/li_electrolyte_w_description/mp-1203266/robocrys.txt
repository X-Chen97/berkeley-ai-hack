Li₂SrAl₄(PO₅)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Ibam space group. Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.49 Å. Sr is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are four shorter (2.63 Å) and four longer (2.67 Å) Sr-O bond lengths. Al is bonded to six O atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share  a cornercorner with one AlO₆ octahedra, corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 30°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.81-2.13 Å. There are two inequivalent P sites. In the first P site, P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-49°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.58 Å. In the second P site, P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 33-47°. There are two shorter (1.54 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are seven inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Al, and one P atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Sr, one Al, and one P atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li, one Al, and one P atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a water-like geometry to one Li and one P atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li and two equivalent Al atoms. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Al atoms. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sr, one Al, and one P atom.
