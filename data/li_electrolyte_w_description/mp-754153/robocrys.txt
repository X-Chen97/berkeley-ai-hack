LiBrH₂O crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent Br¹⁻ atoms to form distorted edge-sharing LiBr₄O₂ octahedra. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. All Li-Br bond lengths are 2.86 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and four equivalent Br¹⁻ atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. There are two shorter (2.68 Å) and two longer (3.11 Å) Li-Br bond lengths. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺ and two equivalent H¹⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂H₂ tetrahedra. Br¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four Li¹⁺ atoms.
