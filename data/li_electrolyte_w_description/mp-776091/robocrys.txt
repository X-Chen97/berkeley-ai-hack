LiNdLaSbO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-34°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.16-2.21 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 32-33°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.20 Å. Nd³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.88 Å. La³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.40-2.91 Å. There are two inequivalent Sb⁵⁺ sites. In the first Sb⁵⁺ site, Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 32-34°. There are four shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. In the second Sb⁵⁺ site, Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-34°. There are four shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, one La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiLaNdSb tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, one La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Nd³⁺, one La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, one La³⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiLaNdSb tetrahedra.
