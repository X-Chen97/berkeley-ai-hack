Li₂CaGeO₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅42m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.99 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.38 Å) and four longer (2.85 Å) Ca-O bond lengths. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All Ge-O bond lengths are 1.78 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
