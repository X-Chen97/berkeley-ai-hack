LiEr₂S₂O₈F₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.12 Å) and two longer (2.51 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There is one shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (2.48 Å) Li-F bond lengths. Er³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and four F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Er-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.36 Å. There are a spread of Er-F bond distances ranging from 2.25-2.44 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.50 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Er³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Er³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Er³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Er³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Er³⁺ atoms. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Er³⁺ atoms.
