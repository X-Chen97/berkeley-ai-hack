RbLiMg₆O₇ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4mm space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Mg²⁺ and five O²⁻ atoms. All Rb-Mg bond lengths are 2.61 Å. There are four shorter (2.35 Å) and one longer (2.90 Å) Rb-O bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-6°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.25 Å. There are four inequivalent Mg²⁺ sites. In the first Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, edges with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent MgO₅ square pyramids.
