LiAlPO₄F crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.46 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.95 Å. There are two inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form AlO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 40°. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.89 Å. Both Al-F bond lengths are 1.86 Å. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form AlO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 40°. There are two shorter (1.86 Å) and two longer (1.90 Å) Al-O bond lengths. Both Al-F bond lengths are 1.86 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 27-50°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.56 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Al³⁺ atoms.
