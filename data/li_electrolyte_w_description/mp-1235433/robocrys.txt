LiPa₂Pr₂O₈ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PaO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, corners with two equivalent PaO₆ pentagonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one PaO₈ hexagonal bipyramid. There are two shorter (1.85 Å) and two longer (2.18 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Pa+4.50+ sites. In the first Pa+4.50+ site, Pa+4.50+ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted PaO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent PaO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent PaO₈ hexagonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Pa-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.30 Å. In the second Pa+4.50+ site, Pa+4.50+ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted PaO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent PaO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent PaO₆ pentagonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Pa-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.47 Å. There are two inequivalent Pr³⁺ sites. In the first Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.45-2.76 Å. In the second Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.34-2.43 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Pa+4.50+, and two Pr³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Pa+4.50+ and two Pr³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OPr₂Pa₂ tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Pa+4.50+, and one Pr³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Pa+4.50+ and two Pr³⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OPr₂Pa₂ tetrahedra.
