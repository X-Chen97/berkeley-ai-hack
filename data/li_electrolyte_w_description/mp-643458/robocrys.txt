LiHSO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.02 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.67 Å) H-O bond length. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.45-1.57 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
