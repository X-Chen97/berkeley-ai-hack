LiH₂O₅Br crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li sites. In the first Li site, Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BrO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 50°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.25 Å. In the second Li site, Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BrO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 50°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.24 Å. There are two inequivalent H sites. In the first H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H site, H is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li and one Br atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.66 Å. In the second O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li and one Br atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.65 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li and one Br atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.64 Å. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li and one Br atom. The O-Br bond length is 1.65 Å. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two Li and two H atoms. Br is bonded to four O atoms to form BrO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 43-55°.
