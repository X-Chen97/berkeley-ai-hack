LiB(OH)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.05 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.51 Å. There are four inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.00 Å) and one longer (1.73 Å) H-O bond length. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.00 Å) and one longer (1.67 Å) H-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
