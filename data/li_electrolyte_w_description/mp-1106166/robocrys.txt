LiGaPO₅ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O¹⁻ and four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.12 Å) and one longer (2.69 Å) Li-O bond length. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.55 Å. There are two inequivalent Ga³⁺ sites. In the first Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two equivalent O¹⁻ and two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both Ga-O bond lengths are 1.82 Å. Both Ga-O bond lengths are 2.06 Å. In the second Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.19 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one GaO₆ octahedra and  an edgeedge with one GaO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 53°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. O¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Ga³⁺ atom. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ga³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
