Li₆PO₅Br crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ and two equivalent Br¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Both Li-Br bond lengths are 2.97 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All P-O bond lengths are 1.56 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form OLi₃P tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent OLi₆ octahedra, corners with six equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra, and edges with three equivalent BrLi₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 58°. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to six equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms to form OLi₆ octahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra and faces with four equivalent BrLi₁₂ cuboctahedra. Br¹⁻ is bonded to twelve equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms to form BrLi₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BrLi₁₂ cuboctahedra, edges with twelve equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra, and faces with four equivalent OLi₆ octahedra.
