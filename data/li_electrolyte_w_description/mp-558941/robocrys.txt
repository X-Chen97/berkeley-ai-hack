LiYSiO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.68 Å. Y³⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form distorted YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with three equivalent YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.44 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids and edges with two equivalent YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.67 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
