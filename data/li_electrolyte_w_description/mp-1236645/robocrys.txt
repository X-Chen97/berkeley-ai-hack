LiPr₂(O₂Br)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ and three Br¹⁻ atoms. The Li-O bond length is 1.91 Å. There is one shorter (2.46 Å) and two longer (2.51 Å) Li-Br bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Pr³⁺ sites. In the first Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻, five O¹⁻, and one Br¹⁻ atom. The Pr-O bond length is 2.44 Å. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.46 Å. The Pr-Br bond length is 3.13 Å. In the second Pr³⁺ site, Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and four O¹⁻ atoms. Both Pr-O bond lengths are 2.50 Å. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.44-2.83 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and three Pr³⁺ atoms. There are three inequivalent O¹⁻ sites. In the first O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three Pr³⁺ atoms. In the second O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Pr³⁺ and one O¹⁻ atom. The O-O bond length is 1.51 Å. In the third O¹⁻ site, O¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Pr³⁺ and one O¹⁻ atom. There are two inequivalent Br¹⁻ sites. In the first Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Pr³⁺ atom. In the second Br¹⁻ site, Br¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
