LiBePO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.01 Å. Be is bonded to four O atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.65 Å. P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.56 Å. There are five inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Be and one P atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one P atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one P atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li, one Be, and one P atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li atom.
