LiSn₂P₃O₁₀ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.07 Å) and two longer (2.09 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.72 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.66 Å. In the third P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.65 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
