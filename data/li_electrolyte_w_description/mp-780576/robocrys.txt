Li₂Sn(SO₄)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with two SO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two SO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 54-60°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.55 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.65 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids and corners with six SO₄ tetrahedra.
