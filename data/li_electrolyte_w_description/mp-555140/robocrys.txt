Cs₂Li₃GaO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Ibam space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.26-3.34 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one GaO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.05 Å) and two longer (2.07 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Ga-O bond lengths are 1.90 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ga³⁺ atom.
