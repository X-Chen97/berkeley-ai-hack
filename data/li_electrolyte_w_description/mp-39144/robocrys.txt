LiSrPrTeO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 21-29°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.19 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 11-coordinate geometry to eleven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.47-3.11 Å. Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.85 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 21-29°. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-1.96 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sr²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
