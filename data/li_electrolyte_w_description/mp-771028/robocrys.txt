Li₃BSiBiO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li sites. In the first Li site, Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.58 Å. In the second Li site, Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.55 Å. B is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.42 Å. Si is bonded to four O atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 52-66°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.66 Å. Bi is bonded to six O atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.24-2.35 Å. There are six inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to three Li and one B atom to form OLi₃B tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent OLi₃BiB trigonal bipyramids,  an edgeedge with one OLi₂SiBi tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one OLi₃BiB trigonal bipyramid. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li, one B, and one Bi atom. In the third O site, O is bonded to three Li, one B, and one Bi atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₃BiB trigonal bipyramids. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li, one Si, and one Bi atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded to two equivalent Li, one Si, and one Bi atom to form distorted OLi₂SiBi tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent OLi₃BiB trigonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li, one Si, and one Bi atom.
