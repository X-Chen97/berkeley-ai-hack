LiCdBO₃ crystallizes in the hexagonal P̅6 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with six equivalent CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.03 Å. Cd²⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent CdO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There is one shorter (2.25 Å) and four longer (2.32 Å) Cd-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.40 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.39 Å. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All B-O bond lengths are 1.39 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂CdB tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
