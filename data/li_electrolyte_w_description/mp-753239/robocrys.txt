LiSnPHO₅ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.58 Å. There are two inequivalent Sn³⁺ sites. In the first Sn³⁺ site, Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 54°. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.44-2.50 Å. In the second Sn³⁺ site, Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 54°. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.18 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 40-54°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.59 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.02 Å) and one longer (1.63 Å) H-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Sn³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
