LiGe₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted hexagonal planar geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.25 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted hexagonal planar geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.27 Å. There are two inequivalent Ge⁴⁺ sites. In the first Ge⁴⁺ site, Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.87 Å) and three longer (1.91 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. In the second Ge⁴⁺ site, Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.86 Å) and three longer (1.90 Å) Ge-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four GeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 26-42°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.55 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ge⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ge⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ge⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ge⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
