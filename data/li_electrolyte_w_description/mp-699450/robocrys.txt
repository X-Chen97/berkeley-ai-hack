LiSO₃NH₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pca2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SNO₃ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-1.99 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SNO₃ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.04 Å. There are two inequivalent N³⁻ sites. In the first N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. The N-H bond length is 1.03 Å. The N-S bond length is 1.52 Å. In the second N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. There is one shorter (1.03 Å) and one longer (1.04 Å) N-H bond length. The N-S bond length is 1.66 Å. There are four inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form SNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.45-1.68 Å. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form SNO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.48 Å) S-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
