Li₃Sb₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.15-2.28 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.69 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.59 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-48°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 48°. There are two shorter (1.53 Å) and two longer (1.59 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SbP trigonal pyramids. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
