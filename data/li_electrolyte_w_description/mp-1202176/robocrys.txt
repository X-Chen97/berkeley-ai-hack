LiY₃(SiO₄)₂F₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.16 Å) and two longer (2.18 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Y³⁺ sites. In the first Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.50 Å. Both Y-F bond lengths are 2.25 Å. In the second Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form distorted YO₆F pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent YO₆F pentagonal bipyramids, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one YO₆F pentagonal bipyramid, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.49 Å. The Y-F bond length is 2.24 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent YO₆F pentagonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one YO₆F pentagonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.67 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Y³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Y³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Y³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two Y³⁺ atoms.
