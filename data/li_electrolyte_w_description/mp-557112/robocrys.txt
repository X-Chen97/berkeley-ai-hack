Li₄Ga₃Si₃O₁₂I crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one I¹⁻ atom to form distorted LiIO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.98 Å. The Li-I bond length is 2.83 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Ga-O bond lengths are 1.83 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.63 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. I¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
