LiSiBi₃O₇ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted face-sharing LiO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (1.98 Å) and three longer (2.35 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.64 Å) and three longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.96 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Si⁴⁺ and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Si⁴⁺ and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
