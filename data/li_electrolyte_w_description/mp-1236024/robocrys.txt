LiBa₂Zn₂(SO)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three S atoms. There are a spread of Li-S bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.41 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent S and four O atoms. Both Ba-S bond lengths are 3.38 Å. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.80-2.97 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent S and four O atoms. There is one shorter (3.29 Å) and one longer (3.30 Å) Ba-S bond length. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.85-2.91 Å. There are two inequivalent Zn sites. In the first Zn site, Zn is bonded to two equivalent S and two O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing ZnS₂O₂ tetrahedra. Both Zn-S bond lengths are 2.34 Å. There is one shorter (2.03 Å) and one longer (2.06 Å) Zn-O bond length. In the second Zn site, Zn is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one S and two O atoms. The Zn-S bond length is 2.38 Å. There is one shorter (2.02 Å) and one longer (2.04 Å) Zn-O bond length. There are two inequivalent S sites. In the first S site, S is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li and two equivalent Zn atoms. In the second S site, S is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li, four Ba, and one Zn atom. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to four Ba and two Zn atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner, face, and edge-sharing OBa₄Zn₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-58°. In the second O site, O is bonded to four Ba and two Zn atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner, face, and edge-sharing OBa₄Zn₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-58°.
