Li₂BBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.07 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.55 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.55 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
