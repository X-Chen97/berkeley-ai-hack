LiLa(CO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.86 Å) and two longer (1.94 Å) Li-O bond lengths. La³⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.51-2.70 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.28 Å) and one longer (1.30 Å) C-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one La³⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent La³⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent La³⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom.
