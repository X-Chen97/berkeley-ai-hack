LiBi(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.40 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.48 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one BiO₆ pentagonal pyramid, and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 41-62°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.61 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 64°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.60 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
