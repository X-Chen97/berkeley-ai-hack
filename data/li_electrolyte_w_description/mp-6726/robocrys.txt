LiCsSO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 11-coordinate geometry to eleven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.11-3.73 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.98 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.49 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to three equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
