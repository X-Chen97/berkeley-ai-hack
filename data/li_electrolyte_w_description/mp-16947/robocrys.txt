LiAlGeO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.06 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.74-1.81 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.75-1.81 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Ge⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
