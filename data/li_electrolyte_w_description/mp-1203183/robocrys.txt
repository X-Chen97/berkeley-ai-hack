LiPNH₃O₃ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.00 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.97 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to two N³⁻ and two O²⁻ atoms to form PN₂O₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.68 Å) and one longer (1.69 Å) P-N bond length. Both P-O bond lengths are 1.51 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to two N³⁻ and two O²⁻ atoms to form PN₂O₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PN₂O₂ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra.
