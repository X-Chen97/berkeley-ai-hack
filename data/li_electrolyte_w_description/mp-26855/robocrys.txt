Li₂Sn(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/nbm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with eight equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.18 Å) and two longer (2.58 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.57 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 43-73°. There are two shorter (1.50 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms.
