LiKSO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cc space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.85-3.16 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.97 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All S-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to three equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
