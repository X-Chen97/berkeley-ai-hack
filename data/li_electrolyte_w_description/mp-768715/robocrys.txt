Li₃B₄BiO₉ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.47 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.64 Å. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one BiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.43-1.52 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one BiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.42-1.53 Å. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.37 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.32 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
