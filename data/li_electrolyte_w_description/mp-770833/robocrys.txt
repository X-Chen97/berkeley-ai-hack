Li₂BSnO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one SnO₄ trigonal pyramid, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SnO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.36 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids, corners with four equivalent SnO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.13 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.43 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid, corners with two equivalent SnO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.34 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sn³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sn³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Sn³⁺ atoms.
