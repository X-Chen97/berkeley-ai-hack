LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.42 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.87 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
