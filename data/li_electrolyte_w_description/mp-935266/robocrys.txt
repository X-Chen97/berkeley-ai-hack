LiC₂NO₆ is Calcite-derived structured and crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent NO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 57°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.14 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. N³⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form NO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 57°. All N-O bond lengths are 1.97 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one N³⁺ atom.
