LiSn(PO₃)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted L-shaped geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.93 Å) and one longer (2.15 Å) Li-O bond length. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.59 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-51°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.66 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 6-57°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.63 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
