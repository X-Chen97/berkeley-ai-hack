LiDy₂(OF)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3m space group. Li is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to two equivalent O and six equivalent F atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.04 Å. All Li-F bond lengths are 2.34 Å. Dy is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O and four equivalent F atoms. There are three shorter (2.28 Å) and one longer (2.37 Å) Dy-O bond length. There is one shorter (2.47 Å) and three longer (2.67 Å) Dy-F bond lengths. O is bonded to one Li and four equivalent Dy atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLiDy₄ trigonal bipyramids. F is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Li and four equivalent Dy atoms.
