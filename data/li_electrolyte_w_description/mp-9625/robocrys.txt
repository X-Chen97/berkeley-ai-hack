LiMgPO₄ is Spinel-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 58-67°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.19 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 51-67°. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.19 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 50-58°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.57 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Mg²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
