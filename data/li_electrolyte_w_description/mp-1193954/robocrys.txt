LiH₆O₇I crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and edges with two equivalent IO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.04-2.35 Å. There are six inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.75 Å) H-O bond length. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.72 Å) H-O bond length.
