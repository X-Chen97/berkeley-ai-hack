Li₂BaP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (1.99 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.66 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three PO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.38 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.73-3.19 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.66 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are three shorter (1.53 Å) and one longer (1.66 Å) P-O bond length. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Ba²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
