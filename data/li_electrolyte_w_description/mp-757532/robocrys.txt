LiSnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.25 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one SnO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.39 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
