K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.80-3.03 Å. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.67-2.85 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.86-3.25 Å. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.60-2.86 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.93 Å) and one longer (1.96 Å) Li-O bond length. The Li-F bond length is 1.81 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.52 Å) and one longer (1.53 Å) S-O bond length. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.47 Å) and one longer (1.48 Å) S-O bond length. The S-F bond length is 1.92 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom.
