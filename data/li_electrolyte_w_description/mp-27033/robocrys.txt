Li₂SnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.62 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (2.14 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.09 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.25-2.39 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.65 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.63 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.

In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
