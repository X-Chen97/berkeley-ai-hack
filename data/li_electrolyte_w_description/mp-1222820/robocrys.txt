Li₂MgGeO₄ is Theoretical Carbon Structure-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one MgO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.07 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.04 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.01 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.77-1.79 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgGe tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OLi₂MgGe trigonal pyramids.
