LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.26 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.56 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-51°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 36-57°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.61 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
