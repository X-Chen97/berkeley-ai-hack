K₃Li₃TeO₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. There are three inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.73 Å) and two longer (2.74 Å) K-O bond lengths. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.54-2.88 Å. In the third K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.63-2.90 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.07 Å) and two longer (2.13 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.06 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-1.99 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four K¹⁺, two Li¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, two Li¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry to two K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
