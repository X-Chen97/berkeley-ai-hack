LiHo₃(GeO₄)₂F₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.12 Å. There are two inequivalent Ho³⁺ sites. In the first Ho³⁺ site, Ho³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form distorted HoO₆F pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent HoO₆F pentagonal bipyramids, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one HoO₆F pentagonal bipyramid, and  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ho-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.44 Å. The Ho-F bond length is 2.23 Å. In the second Ho³⁺ site, Ho³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ho-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.56 Å. Both Ho-F bond lengths are 2.24 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent HoO₆F pentagonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one HoO₆F pentagonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.76-1.81 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Ho³⁺ and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Ho³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Ho³⁺ and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Ho³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two Ho³⁺ atoms.
