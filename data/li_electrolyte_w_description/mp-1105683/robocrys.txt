LiBC₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent BO₂F₂ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.07 Å) and two longer (2.27 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Both Li-F bond lengths are 2.11 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form BO₂F₂ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 34°. Both B-O bond lengths are 1.53 Å. Both B-F bond lengths are 1.39 Å. C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.23 Å) and one longer (1.31 Å) C-O bond length. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one B³⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom.
