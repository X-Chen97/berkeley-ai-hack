K₂Li₃GaO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.77-3.00 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.73-3.19 Å. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one GaO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.11 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.29 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one GaO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.08 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid.
