LiH₂PO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.01 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.61 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.53 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.65 Å) H-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one P⁵⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one P⁵⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms.
