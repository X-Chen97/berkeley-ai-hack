Li₂CBiPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.62 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.62 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.28 Å) and two longer (1.31 Å) C-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.47 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.55 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
