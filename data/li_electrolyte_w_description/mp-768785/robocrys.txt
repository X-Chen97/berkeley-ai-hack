LiSn₂(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra and faces with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.40 Å. Sn+2.50+ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra and  a faceface with one LiO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (2.37 Å) and three longer (2.38 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 29-53°. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.51 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn+2.50+, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn+2.50+ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
