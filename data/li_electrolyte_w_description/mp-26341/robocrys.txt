LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.24 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.65 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 46-59°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid.
