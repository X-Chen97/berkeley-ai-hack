KLiH₄S₂(NO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one N³⁻ and eight O²⁻ atoms. The K-N bond length is 2.94 Å. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.71-3.37 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SNO₃ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.97 Å) and one longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond length. There are two inequivalent N³⁻ sites. In the first N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, two H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. Both N-H bond lengths are 1.03 Å. The N-S bond length is 1.66 Å. In the second N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. Both N-H bond lengths are 1.03 Å. The N-S bond length is 1.67 Å. There are four inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom.
