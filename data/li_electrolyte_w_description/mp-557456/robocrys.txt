Li₄Al₃Ge₃O₁₂I crystallizes in the cubic P̅43n space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent O²⁻ and one I¹⁻ atom to form distorted LiIO₃ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.99 Å. The Li-I bond length is 2.87 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.75 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiIO₃ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Ge-O bond lengths are 1.75 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. I¹⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
