LiBi₃(PO₅)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with three PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one BiO₅ square pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.25 Å. There are three inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-3.04 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.96 Å. In the third Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with three PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ square pyramid. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.45 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ square pyramid and corners with two equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.58 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BiO₅ square pyramid and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids.
