Li₂BSbO₄ is Clathrate-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.15 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.17 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.44 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.04-2.37 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Sb³⁺ atoms.
