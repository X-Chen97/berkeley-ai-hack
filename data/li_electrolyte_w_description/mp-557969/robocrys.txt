LiLa₂S₂O₈F₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form distorted LiO₄F trigonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.34 Å) and two longer (2.54 Å) Li-O bond lengths. The Li-F bond length is 2.01 Å. La³⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and four F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.56-2.76 Å. There are a spread of La-F bond distances ranging from 2.43-2.55 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄F trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.50 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent La³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one La³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one La³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent La³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent La³⁺ atoms. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent La³⁺ atoms.
