LiNdP₄O₁₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.00 Å) and two longer (2.57 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Nd³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.42-2.63 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.61 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 51°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.49-1.62 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Nd³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Nd³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
