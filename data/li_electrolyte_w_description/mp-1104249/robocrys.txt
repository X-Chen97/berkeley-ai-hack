LiNdBO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.19 Å. Nd is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of Nd-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.68 Å. B is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.50 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to one Li, two equivalent Nd, and one B atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiNd₂B trigonal pyramids. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Nd and one B atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Nd, and one B atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li, one Nd, and one B atom.
