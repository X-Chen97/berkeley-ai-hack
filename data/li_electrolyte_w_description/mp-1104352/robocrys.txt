LiZnO₄I crystallizes in the orthorhombic Ama2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.17 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.05 Å) Zn-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Zn²⁺, and one I⁵⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLiZn₂I tetrahedra. The O-I bond length is 2.02 Å. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Zn²⁺, and one I⁵⁺ atom. The O-I bond length is 2.20 Å. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent I⁵⁺ atoms. There is one shorter (1.83 Å) and one longer (2.74 Å) O-I bond length. I⁵⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms.
