Li₃B₂SbO₆ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra,  a cornercorner with one SbO₄ trigonal pyramid, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.11 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.16 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.04 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.46 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.34-1.43 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.02-2.62 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom.
