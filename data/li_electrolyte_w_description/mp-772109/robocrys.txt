LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.06 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.65 Å) and two longer (1.67 Å) Si-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.34-2.94 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Si⁴⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
