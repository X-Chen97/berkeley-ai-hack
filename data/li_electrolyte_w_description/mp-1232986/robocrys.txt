LiTb₂(PO₄)₂ is Esseneite-like structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.15 Å. Tb³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Tb-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.79 Å. P+4.50+ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 49°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Tb³⁺, and one P+4.50+ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Tb³⁺, and one P+4.50+ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Tb³⁺, and one P+4.50+ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Tb³⁺ and one P+4.50+ atom.
