LiBa₃(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.92 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.69-3.18 Å. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.65-2.97 Å. As is bonded in a trigonal pyramidal geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.77-1.82 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, two Ba, and one As atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to four Ba and one As atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Ba and one As atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, three Ba, and one As atom.
