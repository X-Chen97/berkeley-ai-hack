LiCaBO₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.67 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.53 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.40 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
