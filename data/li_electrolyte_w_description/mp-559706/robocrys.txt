Li₃Gd(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.05 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (2.06 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.87-1.95 Å. Gd³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Gd-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.64 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.40 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.37 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Gd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Gd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.

In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Gd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, two equivalent Gd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Gd³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
