Li₂Sn(H₅O₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 51-53°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-1.96 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.06 Å) and two longer (2.10 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.58 Å) H-O bond length. In the fifth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and two H¹⁺ atoms.
