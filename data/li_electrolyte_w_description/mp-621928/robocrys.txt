LiEu(SO₄)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P̅4n2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.92 Å. Eu³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.44 Å) and four longer (2.59 Å) Eu-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.49 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Eu³⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Eu³⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
