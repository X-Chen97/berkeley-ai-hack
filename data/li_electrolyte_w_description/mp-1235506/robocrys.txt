K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.83-3.33 Å. There are two shorter (2.70 Å) and one longer (2.81 Å) K-F bond length. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.80-2.90 Å. There is one shorter (2.60 Å) and one longer (2.82 Å) K-F bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.92 Å) and one longer (1.96 Å) Li-O bond length. The Li-F bond length is 1.78 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.52 Å) and one longer (1.53 Å) S-O bond length. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.48 Å. The S-F bond length is 1.81 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom.
