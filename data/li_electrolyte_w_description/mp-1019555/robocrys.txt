Li₃NaBaB₆O₁₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.34 Å) and three longer (2.45 Å) Na-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.10 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.80-3.21 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.46-1.51 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.35 Å) and two longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Ba²⁺, and two B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and two B³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ba²⁺, and two equivalent B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ba²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
