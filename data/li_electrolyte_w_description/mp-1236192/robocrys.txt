LiPu₂TeO₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Pu, one Te, and four equivalent O atoms. The Li-Pu bond length is 2.52 Å. The Li-Te bond length is 2.53 Å. There are two shorter (2.20 Å) and two longer (2.22 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Pu sites. In the first Pu site, Pu is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O atoms. All Pu-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. In the second Pu site, Pu is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one Li, four equivalent Te, and four equivalent O atoms. There are three shorter (3.31 Å) and one longer (3.32 Å) Pu-Te bond length. There are two shorter (2.58 Å) and two longer (2.59 Å) Pu-O bond lengths. Te is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li and four equivalent Pu atoms. O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li and four Pu atoms.
