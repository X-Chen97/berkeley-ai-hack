Li₂H₂SO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-1.98 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.01 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with seven LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.50 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
