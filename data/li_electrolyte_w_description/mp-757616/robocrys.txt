LiSn(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.80 Å) and one longer (1.84 Å) Li-O bond length. Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.32 Å. There are four inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra.
