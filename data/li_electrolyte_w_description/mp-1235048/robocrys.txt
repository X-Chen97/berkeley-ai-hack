KKLiLa₄O₇ crystallizes in the trigonal P3 space group. The structure consists of one K cluster inside a KLiLa₄O₇ framework. In the K cluster, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the KLiLa₄O₇ framework, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All K-O bond lengths are 2.87 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. La²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six LaO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (2.48 Å) and three longer (2.49 Å) La-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent La³⁺ sites. In the first La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LaO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-62°. There is one shorter (2.28 Å) and three longer (2.37 Å) La-O bond lengths. In the second La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LaO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 57-60°. There is one shorter (2.26 Å) and three longer (2.32 Å) La-O bond lengths. In the third La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six LaO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent LaO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (2.36 Å) and three longer (2.49 Å) La-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one La²⁺, and two La³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, one La²⁺, and two La³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two La³⁺ atoms.
