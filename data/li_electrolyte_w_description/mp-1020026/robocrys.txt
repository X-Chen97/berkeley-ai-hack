LiBeBO₃ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with five equivalent BeO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.08 Å. Be²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with five equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one BeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Be-O bond distances ranging from 1.58-1.72 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.41 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Be²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Be²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted edge-sharing OLiBe₂B tetrahedra.
