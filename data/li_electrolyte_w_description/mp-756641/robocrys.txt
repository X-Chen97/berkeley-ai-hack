Li₂BCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-2.46 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.47 Å) and two longer (1.49 Å) B-O bond lengths. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.26 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) C-O bond length. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.58 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one B³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
