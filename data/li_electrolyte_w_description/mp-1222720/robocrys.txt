Li₂Al₂SiO₆ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.76 Å) and two longer (1.77 Å) Al-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.63 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms.
