Li₂Ga₃Te₆(HO₂)₁₂ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share  a faceface with one GaO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (2.04 Å) and three longer (2.32 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share  a faceface with one LiO₆ octahedra. There are three shorter (2.01 Å) and three longer (2.02 Å) Ga-O bond lengths. Ga⁴⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Ga-O bond lengths are 1.99 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.00 Å) and one longer (1.70 Å) H-O bond length. Te⁴⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-1.92 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Te⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ga³⁺ and one Te⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Ga⁴⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Te⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms.
