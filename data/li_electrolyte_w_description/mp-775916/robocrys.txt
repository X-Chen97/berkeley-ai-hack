LiSnCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.66 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.02-2.17 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.24-1.35 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 33-47°. There is one shorter (1.54 Å) and three longer (1.55 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Sn⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sn⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
