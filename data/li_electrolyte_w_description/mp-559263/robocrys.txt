K₂Li₄UO₆ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3m1 space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All K-O bond lengths are 2.58 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share faces with two equivalent UO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.41 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.13 Å. U⁶⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share faces with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. All U-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. O²⁻ is bonded to one K¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one U⁶⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OKLi₃U trigonal bipyramids.
