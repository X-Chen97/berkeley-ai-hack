Li₂BBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.10 Å. B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.46 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) B-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.65 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
