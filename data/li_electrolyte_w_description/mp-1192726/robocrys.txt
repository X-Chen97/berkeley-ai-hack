NaLiSi₂H₄O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted NaO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent NaO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.56 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NaO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one NaO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 63°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one NaO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.66 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms.
