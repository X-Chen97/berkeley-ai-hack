LiCaPrTeO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic Pc space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 29-37°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.43 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.75 Å. Pr³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pr-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.78 Å. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 29-37°. There are five shorter (1.95 Å) and one longer (1.97 Å) Te-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiCaPrTe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, two equivalent Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, one Pr³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLiCaPrTe tetrahedra.
