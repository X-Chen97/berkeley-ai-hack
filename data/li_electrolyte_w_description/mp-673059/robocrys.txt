LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ pentagonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.36 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.57 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.64 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids.
