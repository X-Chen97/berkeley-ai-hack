LiMg₆AlO₈ is Caswellsilverite-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/mmm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with twelve MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are four shorter (2.10 Å) and two longer (2.40 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent Mg²⁺ sites. In the first Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six MgO₆ octahedra, edges with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra, and edges with eight equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Mg-O bond lengths are 2.10 Å. In the second Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six MgO₆ octahedra, edges with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with eight equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are four shorter (2.10 Å) and two longer (2.14 Å) Mg-O bond lengths. In the third Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra, and edges with eight MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-20°. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.21 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra, and edges with twelve MgO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are two shorter (1.84 Å) and four longer (2.10 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent Mg²⁺, and one Al³⁺ atom to form distorted OLiMg₄Al octahedra that share corners with six equivalent OLiMg₄Al octahedra and edges with twelve OMg₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-20°. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to six Mg²⁺ atoms to form OMg₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent OMg₆ octahedra and edges with twelve OLiMg₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-6°. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four Mg²⁺ and two equivalent Al³⁺ atoms to form OMg₄Al₂ octahedra that share corners with six OMg₄Al₂ octahedra and edges with twelve OLiMg₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four Mg²⁺ atoms to form OLi₂Mg₄ octahedra that share corners with six OMg₄Al₂ octahedra and edges with twelve OLiMg₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four Mg²⁺ atoms to form OLi₂Mg₄ octahedra that share corners with six OMg₄Al₂ octahedra and edges with twelve OLiMg₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. Both O-Mg bond lengths are 2.03 Å.
