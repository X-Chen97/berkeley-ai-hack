Li₃Sb₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.15 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.74 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.50 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 19-64°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.57 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 40-53°.
