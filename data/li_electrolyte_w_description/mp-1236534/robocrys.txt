Cs₂Li(O₃I)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent Cs sites. In the first Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.25-3.75 Å. In the second Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 11-coordinate geometry to one Li and ten O atoms. The Cs-Li bond length is 3.17 Å. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.09-3.75 Å. Li is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Cs and four O atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.49 Å. There are six inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to three Cs, one Li, and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.87 Å. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Cs and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.86 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Cs and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.83 Å. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Cs, two equivalent Li, and two I atoms. There is one shorter (2.05 Å) and one longer (2.56 Å) O-I bond length. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three Cs, one Li, and two equivalent I atoms. There is one shorter (1.91 Å) and one longer (2.65 Å) O-I bond length. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four Cs and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.94 Å. There are two inequivalent I sites. In the first I site, I is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O atoms. In the second I site, I is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four O atoms.
