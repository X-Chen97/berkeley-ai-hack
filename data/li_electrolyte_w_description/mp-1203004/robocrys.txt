There is one shorter (2.07 Å) and one longer (2.10 Å) Mg-F bond length. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra, corners with three equivalent MgO₄F₂ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 41-62°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.57 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with three equivalent MgO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 52-61°. There are three shorter (1.55 Å) and one longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃P tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent OLi₃P tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent OLi₂MgP trigonal pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one OLi₂MgP trigonal pyramid.
