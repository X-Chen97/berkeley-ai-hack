Li₃B₂SbO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid, corners with three equivalent SbO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.18 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent SbO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.50 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.35 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.39 Å) and two longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.41 Å) B-O bond length. Sb³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.14-2.43 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom.
