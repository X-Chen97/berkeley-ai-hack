LiLa₂(AsO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one AsO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.90 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent La+2.50+ sites. In the first La+2.50+ site, La+2.50+ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.49-2.57 Å. In the second La+2.50+ site, La+2.50+ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.47-2.68 Å. There are two inequivalent As⁵⁺ sites. In the first As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.79 Å) and two longer (1.95 Å) As-O bond lengths. In the second As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₄ tetrahedra that share  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.71 Å) and two longer (1.75 Å) As-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two La+2.50+ and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two La+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two La+2.50+ and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two La+2.50+, and one As⁵⁺ atom.
