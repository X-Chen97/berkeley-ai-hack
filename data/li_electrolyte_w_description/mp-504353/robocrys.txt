LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (2.03 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.45 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ pentagonal pyramids and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.61 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one SbO₆ pentagonal pyramid and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.63 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
