LiBa₂TbSnO₆ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Ba²⁺ and three O²⁻ atoms. The Li-Ba bond length is 2.64 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.88 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba²⁺ sites. In the first Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent TbO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 3.01-3.30 Å. In the second Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.65-3.08 Å. Tb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 1-4°. There are three shorter (2.20 Å) and three longer (2.39 Å) Tb-O bond lengths. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TbO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 1-4°. There are three shorter (2.03 Å) and three longer (2.23 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom.
