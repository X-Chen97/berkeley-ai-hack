Ba₄LiSb₃O₁₂ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic Im̅3m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.24 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. There are six shorter (2.95 Å) and six longer (2.96 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and four longer (2.09 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four equivalent Ba²⁺ and two equivalent Sb⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺, four equivalent Ba²⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
