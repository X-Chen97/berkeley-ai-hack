LiSb₃TeO₆Cl crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.88 Å) and one longer (2.00 Å) Li-O bond length. There are three inequivalent Sb+2.67+ sites. In the first Sb+2.67+ site, Sb+2.67+ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and two equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.23 Å. Both Sb-Cl bond lengths are 3.18 Å. In the second Sb+2.67+ site, Sb+2.67+ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.19 Å. In the third Sb+2.67+ site, Sb+2.67+ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.19 Å. Te⁴⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and two equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.19 Å. Both Te-Cl bond lengths are 3.37 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Sb+2.67+, one Te⁴⁺, and one Cl¹⁻ atom. The O-Cl bond length is 3.15 Å.
