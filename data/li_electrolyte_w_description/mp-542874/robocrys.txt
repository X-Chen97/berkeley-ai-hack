LiAlSi₂O₆ is Esseneite-like structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.56 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.84-2.05 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 27-60°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.60-1.66 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 42-58°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.67 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiAl₂Si trigonal pyramids. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLiAl₂Si trigonal pyramids.
