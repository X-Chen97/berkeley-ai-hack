LiGaPO₄F crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.73 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.91 Å. There are two inequivalent Ga³⁺ sites. In the first Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form GaO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 47°. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Ga-O bond lengths. Both Ga-F bond lengths are 1.97 Å. In the second Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form GaO₄F₂ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₄F₂ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 47°. All Ga-O bond lengths are 1.96 Å. Both Ga-F bond lengths are 1.98 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four GaO₄F₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 35-54°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.57 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Ga³⁺ atoms.
