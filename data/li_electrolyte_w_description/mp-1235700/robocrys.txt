LiSm₂SO₂ is Caswellsilverite-derived structured and crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3m1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SmS₃O₃ octahedra, edges with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with six equivalent SmS₃O₃ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 3°. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.47 Å. Sm+2.50+ is bonded to three equivalent S²⁻ and three equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SmS₃O₃ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent SmS₃O₃ octahedra, edges with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with nine equivalent SmS₃O₃ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-3°. All Sm-S bond lengths are 2.79 Å. All Sm-O bond lengths are 2.40 Å. S²⁻ is bonded to six equivalent Sm+2.50+ atoms to form SSm₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent OLi₃Sm₃ octahedra, edges with six equivalent SSm₆ octahedra, and edges with six equivalent OLi₃Sm₃ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 12°. O²⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Sm+2.50+ atoms to form OLi₃Sm₃ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent SSm₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent OLi₃Sm₃ octahedra, edges with three equivalent SSm₆ octahedra, and edges with nine equivalent OLi₃Sm₃ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-12°.
