LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pca2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four BiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.03 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four BiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.99 Å) and three longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four BiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.67 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four BiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.65 Å) and two longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra.
