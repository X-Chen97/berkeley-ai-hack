Na₂Li₃P₆(HO₂)₁₂Na(H₂O)₆ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3c space group. The structure consists of six Na(H₂O)₆ clusters inside a Na₂Li₃P₆(HO₂)₁₂ framework. In each Na(H₂O)₆ cluster, Na¹⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Na-O bond lengths are 2.39 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Na¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the Na₂Li₃P₆(HO₂)₁₂ framework, Na¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form NaO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.42 Å) and three longer (2.52 Å) Na-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent NaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 71°. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (1.99 Å) Li-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one NaO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 53°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.62 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Na¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and two H¹⁺ atoms.
