LiAlSiH₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.05 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.77 Å) and two longer (1.78 Å) Al-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.64 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
