Li(OCN) crystallizes in the trigonal R3m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three equivalent N³⁻ and three equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form edge-sharing LiN₃O₃ octahedra. All Li-N bond lengths are 2.18 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to one N³⁻ and one O²⁻ atom. The C-N bond length is 1.19 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.23 Å. N³⁻ is bonded to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing NLi₃C tetrahedra. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom.
