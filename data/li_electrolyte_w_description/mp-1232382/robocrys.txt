LiSiPO₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.15 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 34°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.71-1.92 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 41-43°. There are three shorter (1.54 Å) and one longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Si⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms.
