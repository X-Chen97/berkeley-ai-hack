LiNa₃P₂O₇ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Na¹⁺ sites. In the first Na¹⁺ site, Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-2.88 Å. In the second Na¹⁺ site, Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-3.03 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (1.99 Å) Li-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.64 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Na¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
