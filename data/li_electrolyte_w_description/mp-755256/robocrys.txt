LiB₂BiO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (2.03 Å) Li-O bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.41 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.43-2.88 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
