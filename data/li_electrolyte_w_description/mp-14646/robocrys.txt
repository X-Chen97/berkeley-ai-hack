Li₂Mg₂(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent MgO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.95 Å. Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Mg-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.14 Å. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 25-38°. There are two shorter (1.45 Å) and two longer (1.48 Å) S-O bond lengths. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 13-45°. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.45-1.48 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Mg²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Mg²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Mg²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom.
