LiCH₂O₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-1.99 Å. C³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one H¹⁺ and two O²⁻ atoms. The C-H bond length is 1.11 Å. Both C-O bond lengths are 1.27 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C³⁺ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.71 Å) H-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom.
