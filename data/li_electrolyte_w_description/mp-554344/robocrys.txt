Li₃AlB₂O₆ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one AlO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.87-2.21 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share  a cornercorner with one AlO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.16 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.76-1.78 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.36 Å) and two longer (1.41 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.42 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites.
