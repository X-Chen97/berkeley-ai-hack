CsLiAcO₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R3m space group. Cs is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to one Li and nine equivalent O atoms. The Cs-Li bond length is 2.99 Å. There are three shorter (3.27 Å) and six longer (3.33 Å) Cs-O bond lengths. Li is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Cs and three equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.94 Å. Ac is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing AcO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 15°. There are three shorter (2.41 Å) and three longer (2.58 Å) Ac-O bond lengths. O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Cs, one Li, and two equivalent Ac atoms.
