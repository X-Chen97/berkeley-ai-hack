Li₂SrSiO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal P3_121 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.04 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.59-2.70 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.66 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
