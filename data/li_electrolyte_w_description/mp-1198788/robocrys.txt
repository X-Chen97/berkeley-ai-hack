Li₂Ba₆Si₄O₁₅Cl crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃/mmc space group. Li is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.98 Å. There are four inequivalent Ba sites. In the first Ba site, Ba is bonded to twelve O atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share edges with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra and edges with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are six shorter (2.89 Å) and six longer (3.33 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. In the second Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to nine O and one Cl atom. There are three shorter (2.78 Å) and six longer (3.00 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. The Ba-Cl bond length is 3.05 Å. In the third Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.55-3.08 Å. In the fourth Ba site, Ba is bonded in a 12-coordinate geometry to nine O and three equivalent Cl atoms. There are six shorter (2.88 Å) and three longer (3.33 Å) Ba-O bond lengths. All Ba-Cl bond lengths are 3.33 Å. There are two inequivalent Si sites. In the first Si site, Si is bonded to four O atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share edges with three equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. There is one shorter (1.63 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. In the second Si site, Si is bonded to four O atoms to form corner-sharing SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.65 Å) and one longer (1.68 Å) Si-O bond length. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Ba and one Si atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a linear geometry to three equivalent Ba and two equivalent Si atoms. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to four Ba and one Si atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, four Ba, and one Si atom. Cl is bonded to five Ba atoms to form corner-sharing ClBa₅ trigonal bipyramids.
