LiSiBiO₄ is Ilmenite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, and edges with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.33 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ pentagonal pyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 54°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.68 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 55-74°. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.44 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SiBi trigonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
