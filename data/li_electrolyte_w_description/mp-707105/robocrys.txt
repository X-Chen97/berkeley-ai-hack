Li₃B₅O₈(OH)₂ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4_12_12 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.40 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.48 Å. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing BO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.48 Å) and one longer (1.51 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.39 Å. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing BO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.47 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) B-O bond lengths. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms to form distorted edge-sharing OLi₂B₂ tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom.
