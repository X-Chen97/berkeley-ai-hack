Li₂(H₂O)₇(BH)₁₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of forty-eight BH clusters and four Li₂(H₂O)₇ clusters. In each BH cluster, B¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one H+0.92+ atom. The B-H bond length is 1.20 Å. H+0.92+ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one B¹⁻ atom. In each Li₂(H₂O)₇ cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.05 Å. There are four inequivalent H+0.92+ sites. In the first H+0.92+ site, H+0.92+ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H+0.92+ site, H+0.92+ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the third H+0.92+ site, H+0.92+ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the fourth H+0.92+ site, H+0.92+ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent H+0.92+ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent H+0.92+ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H+0.92+ atoms.
