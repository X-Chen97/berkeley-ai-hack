LiBBi₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.53 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.36 Å) and two longer (1.42 Å) B-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing BiO₆ pentagonal pyramids. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.62 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and four equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one B³⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂Bi₂ tetrahedra.
