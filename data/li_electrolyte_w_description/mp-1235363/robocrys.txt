LiZn₂Al₄O₈ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Imm2 space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one AlO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 43-62°. There are two shorter (1.90 Å) and two longer (1.99 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Zn is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O atoms. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.16 Å. There are three inequivalent Al sites. In the first Al site, Al is bonded to four O atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 54-57°. There are two shorter (1.85 Å) and two longer (1.90 Å) Al-O bond lengths. In the second Al site, Al is bonded to six O atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six AlO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.08 Å. In the third Al site, Al is bonded to four O atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 52-53°. There are two shorter (1.80 Å) and two longer (1.93 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Zn, and two Al atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Zn and three Al atoms. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li and three Al atoms. In the fourth O site, O is bonded to two equivalent Zn and two Al atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OAl₂Zn₂ tetrahedra.
