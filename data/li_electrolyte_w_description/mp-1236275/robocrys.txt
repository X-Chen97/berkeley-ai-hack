LiNdPrO₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.83 Å. Nd is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form distorted edge-sharing NdO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.39 Å) and four longer (2.85 Å) Nd-O bond lengths. Pr is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Pr-O bond lengths are 2.56 Å. O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li, three equivalent Nd, and one Pr atom.
