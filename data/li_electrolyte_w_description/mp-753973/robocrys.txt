LiSnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.09 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.37 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 48-54°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-52°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.62 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
