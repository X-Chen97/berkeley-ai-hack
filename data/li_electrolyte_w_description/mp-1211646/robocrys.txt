Li₃Lu₃Te₂O₁₂ crystallizes in the cubic Ia̅3d space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 53°. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.88 Å. Lu³⁺ is bonded in a body-centered cubic geometry to eight equivalent O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.32 Å) and four longer (2.42 Å) Lu-O bond lengths. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Te-O bond lengths are 1.95 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Lu³⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom.
