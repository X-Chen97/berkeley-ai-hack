LiAlSi₂O₆ is Esseneite structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.29 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.83-2.03 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 31-60°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.60-1.66 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLiAl₂Si tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms.
