Li₃Sb(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.51 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.30 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (1.96 Å) and three longer (2.55 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Sb³⁺ sites. In the first Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded in a distorted hexagonal planar geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sb-O bond lengths are 2.48 Å. In the second Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.24 Å) and three longer (2.35 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 54°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.60 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Sb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
