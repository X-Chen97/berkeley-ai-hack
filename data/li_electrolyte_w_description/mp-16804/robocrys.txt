LiCaPO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal P31c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.04 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.30-2.58 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.56 Å) and three longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.54 Å) and one longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond length. In the third P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.55 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Ca²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ca²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three equivalent Ca²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry to three equivalent Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
