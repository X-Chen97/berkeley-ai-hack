LiSn(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4₂/nnm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with eight PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (2.15 Å) and two longer (2.52 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sn³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (2.35 Å) and four longer (2.45 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 73°. There are two shorter (1.50 Å) and two longer (1.64 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are two shorter (1.51 Å) and two longer (1.62 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sn³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
