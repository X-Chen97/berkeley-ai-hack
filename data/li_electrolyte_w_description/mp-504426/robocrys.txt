LiN₂H₅SO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. The structure consists of four NH₂ clusters and four NH₃ clusters inside a LiSO₄ framework. In each NH₂ cluster, N²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two H¹⁺ atoms. There is one shorter (1.03 Å) and one longer (1.04 Å) N-H bond length. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N²⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N²⁻ atom. In each NH₃ cluster, N²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three H¹⁺ atoms. There are two shorter (1.04 Å) and one longer (1.05 Å) N-H bond length. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N²⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N²⁻ atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N²⁻ atom. In the LiSO₄ framework, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.99 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.51 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
