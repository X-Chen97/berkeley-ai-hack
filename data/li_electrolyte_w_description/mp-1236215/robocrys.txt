CsLiAcO₃ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/mmm space group. Cs is bonded to two equivalent Li and four equivalent O atoms to form distorted CsLi₂O₄ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent CsLi₂O₄ octahedra, corners with eight equivalent AcO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent CsLi₂O₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-90°. Both Cs-Li bond lengths are 2.70 Å. All Cs-O bond lengths are 3.33 Å. Li is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Cs and four equivalent O atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.35 Å. Ac is bonded to six O atoms to form AcO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AcO₆ octahedra and corners with eight equivalent CsLi₂O₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-90°. There are four shorter (2.35 Å) and two longer (2.70 Å) Ac-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Li and two equivalent Ac atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded to four equivalent Cs and two equivalent Ac atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing OCs₄Ac₂ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted.
