LiUAsO₆ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three UO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one UO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 26-66°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.45 Å. There are two inequivalent U⁶⁺ sites. In the first U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.83-2.38 Å. In the second U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.82-2.32 Å.
