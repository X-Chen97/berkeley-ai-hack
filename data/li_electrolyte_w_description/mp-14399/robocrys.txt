LiAlSiO₄ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6_222 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.02 Å) and two longer (2.04 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.06 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.02 Å. There are two inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.75 Å) and two longer (1.76 Å) Al-O bond lengths. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.75 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
