K₉Li₃O₁₃I₂ crystallizes in the hexagonal P̅62c space group. There are three inequivalent K sites. In the first K site, K is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.63-2.86 Å. In the second K site, K is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (2.74 Å) and two longer (2.89 Å) K-O bond lengths. In the third K site, K is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.78-3.18 Å. Li is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.92 Å) and two longer (1.95 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent K atoms. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four K, one Li, and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.93 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to four K, one Li, and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.92 Å. I is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six O atoms.
