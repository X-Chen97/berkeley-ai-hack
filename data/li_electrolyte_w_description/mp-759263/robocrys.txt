In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and four longer (2.35 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.71 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.58 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 64°.
