LiSc₄(Si₂O₇)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Imm2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with twelve ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids and faces with four SiO₆ octahedra. There is one shorter (1.87 Å) and five longer (1.88 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Sc+2.75+ sites. In the first Sc+2.75+ site, Sc+2.75+ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with six ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and edges with six SiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.39 Å. In the second Sc+2.75+ site, Sc+2.75+ is bonded to eight O²⁻ atoms to form distorted ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with six ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and edges with six SiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 45°. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.39 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₆ octahedra, edges with six ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and  a faceface with one LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 39-50°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.75-1.88 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₆ octahedra, edges with six ScO₈ hexagonal bipyramids, and  a faceface with one LiO₆ octahedra.
