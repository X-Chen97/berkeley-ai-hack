LiAlB₂O₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.07-2.43 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 27-63°. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.75-1.79 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.42 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.43 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
