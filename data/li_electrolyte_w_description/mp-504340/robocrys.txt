LiSb(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.83 Å) and one longer (1.85 Å) Li-O bond length. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.33 Å. There are four inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra.
