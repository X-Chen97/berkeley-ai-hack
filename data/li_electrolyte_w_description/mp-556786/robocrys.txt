LiCdPO₄ is Hausmannite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent CdO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent CdO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-72°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.45 Å. Cd²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CdO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent CdO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-72°. There are a spread of Cd-O bond distances ranging from 2.26-2.41 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent CdO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one CdO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 49-59°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Cd²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
