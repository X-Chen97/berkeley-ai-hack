LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.06 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.67 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.99 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
