LiZn(SbO₂)₄ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent O¹⁻ and two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.28 Å) and one longer (2.37 Å) Li-O bond length. There is one shorter (1.96 Å) and one longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond length. Zn²⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O¹⁻ and three O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three SbO₅ square pyramids, corners with two equivalent ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. Both Zn-O bond lengths are 2.10 Å. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.36 Å. There are four inequivalent Sb³⁺ sites. In the first Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₅ square pyramids that share  a cornercorner with one ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramid and edges with four SbO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.37 Å. In the second Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.10 Å) Sb-O bond lengths. In the third Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to one O¹⁻ and five O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₅ square pyramids, edges with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids. The Sb-O bond length is 2.16 Å. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.19 Å. In the fourth Sb³⁺ site, Sb³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₅ square pyramids that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent ZnO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and edges with four SbO₅ square pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 63°. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.45 Å. O¹⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Zn²⁺, and one Sb³⁺ atom to form edge-sharing OLi₂Zn₂Sb square pyramids. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites.
