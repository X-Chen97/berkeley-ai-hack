Li₆CaCeO₆ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅31c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent CeO₆ octahedra, corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one CaO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one CeO₆ octahedra, and edges with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 25-55°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.12 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form CaO₆ octahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with three equivalent CeO₆ octahedra, and edges with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Ca-O bond lengths are 2.38 Å. Ce⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form CeO₆ octahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with three equivalent CaO₆ octahedra, and edges with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. All Ce-O bond lengths are 2.28 Å. O²⁻ is bonded to four equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one Ce⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₄CaCe pentagonal pyramids.
