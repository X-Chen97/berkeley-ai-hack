LiNaCO₃ crystallizes in the hexagonal P̅62m space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted NaO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent NaO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent NaO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 7°. There are four shorter (2.43 Å) and two longer (2.52 Å) Na-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with four equivalent NaO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (2.05 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent C⁴⁺ sites. In the first C⁴⁺ site, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. In the second C⁴⁺ site, C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All C-O bond lengths are 1.30 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Na¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing ONa₂Li₂C trigonal bipyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom.
