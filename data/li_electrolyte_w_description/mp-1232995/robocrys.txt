Rb₂LiPu(OCl₂)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Cm space group. There are two inequivalent Rb¹⁺ sites. In the first Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ and eight Cl¹⁻ atoms. The Rb-O bond length is 3.37 Å. There are a spread of Rb-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.45-3.64 Å. In the second Rb¹⁺ site, Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one O²⁻ and eight Cl¹⁻ atoms. The Rb-O bond length is 3.01 Å. There are a spread of Rb-Cl bond distances ranging from 3.57-3.70 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one O²⁻ and two equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. The Li-O bond length is 1.89 Å. Both Li-Cl bond lengths are 2.35 Å. Pu⁵⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ and two equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.81 Å) and one longer (1.85 Å) Pu-O bond length. Both Pu-Cl bond lengths are 2.72 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Rb¹⁺ and one Pu⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Rb¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one Pu⁵⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent Cl¹⁻ sites.
