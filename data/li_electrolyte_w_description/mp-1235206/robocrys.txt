K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and two F¹⁻ atoms to form distorted KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₃F tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.85-3.03 Å. There is one shorter (2.63 Å) and one longer (2.68 Å) K-F bond length. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.77 Å) and one longer (2.79 Å) K-O bond length. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.65-2.91 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form LiO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent KO₃F₂ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.07 Å. The Li-F bond length is 1.85 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. Both S-O bond lengths are 1.53 Å. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.48 Å) and one longer (1.49 Å) S-O bond length. The S-F bond length is 1.80 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S³⁺ atom. There are two inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to three K¹⁺ and one Li¹⁺ atom.
