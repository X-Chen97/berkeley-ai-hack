Li₄Sb₂H₂OF₁₀(H₂O)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. The structure consists of four H₂O clusters inside a Li₄Sb₂H₂OF₁₀ framework. In each H₂O cluster, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent H¹⁺ atoms. In the Li₄Sb₂H₂OF₁₀ framework, there are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-F bond distances ranging from 2.40-2.66 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to one O²⁻ and five F¹⁻ atoms to form distorted LiOF₅ octahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiOF₅ octahedra and corners with five equivalent SbF₅ square pyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 14°. The Li-O bond length is 2.33 Å. There are a spread of Li-F bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.14 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to five F¹⁻ atoms to form distorted SbF₅ square pyramids that share corners with five equivalent LiOF₅ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 12-39°. There are a spread of Sb-F bond distances ranging from 2.02-2.16 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 1.00 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. There are five inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom to form distorted edge-sharing FLi₃Sb tetrahedra. In the fourth F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom. In the fifth F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Sb³⁺ atom.
