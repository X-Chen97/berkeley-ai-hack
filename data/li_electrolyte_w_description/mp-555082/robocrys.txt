CsLi₅(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 14-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ and ten O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (3.27 Å) and two longer (3.37 Å) Cs-Li bond lengths. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.26-3.79 Å. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent Cs¹⁺ and four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner, edge, and face-sharing LiCs₂O₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.05 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.00 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted square co-planar geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.41 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Cs¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
