Li₂AlCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.28 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.84-2.03 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.27-1.33 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 42-48°. There are two shorter (1.54 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
