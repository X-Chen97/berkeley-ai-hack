LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.71 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.69 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.51 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SiBi trigonal pyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
