Li₄Sn(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnnm space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₅ trigonal bipyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.37 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids, and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 15-83°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.01 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.41 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are four shorter (2.44 Å) and two longer (2.59 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and two equivalent Sn²⁺ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLi₂Sn₂B trigonal bipyramids. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Sn²⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom.
