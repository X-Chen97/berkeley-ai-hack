LiAs₂H₃O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.98 Å. There are two inequivalent As⁵⁺ sites. In the first As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing AsO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 61°. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.64-1.74 Å. In the second As⁵⁺ site, As⁵⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AsO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent AsO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one AsO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of As-O bond distances ranging from 1.78-1.87 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.03 Å) and one longer (1.49 Å) H-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one As⁵⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent As⁵⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one As⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two As⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one As⁵⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom.
