LiAlSiO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pc space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four AlO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.18 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.11 Å. There are two inequivalent Al³⁺ sites. In the first Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.76 Å) and one longer (1.77 Å) Al-O bond length. In the second Al³⁺ site, Al³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.74-1.79 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four AlO₄ tetrahedra.
