Li₂(OH)Cl crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ and two equivalent Cl¹⁻ atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.96 Å. There is one shorter (2.45 Å) and one longer (2.48 Å) Li-Cl bond length. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ atoms.
