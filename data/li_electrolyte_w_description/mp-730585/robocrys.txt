LiBH₂OF₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnna space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O²⁻ and four F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₂F₄ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BF₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 53°. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.09 Å. There are two shorter (2.04 Å) and two longer (2.14 Å) Li-F bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to two equivalent O²⁻ and four F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₂F₄ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₂F₄ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BF₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 53°. Both Li-O bond lengths are 2.10 Å. There are two shorter (2.04 Å) and two longer (2.16 Å) Li-F bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded to four F¹⁻ atoms to form BF₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₂F₄ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 33-39°. There is one shorter (1.41 Å) and three longer (1.42 Å) B-F bond lengths. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. There are four inequivalent F¹⁻ sites. In the first F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the second F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the third F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the fourth F¹⁻ site, F¹⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom.
