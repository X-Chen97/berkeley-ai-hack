Li₃Sn(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.07 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.07 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.03 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.39 Å) and one longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond length. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.40 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.58 Å.
