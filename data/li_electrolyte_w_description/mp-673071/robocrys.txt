Li₂SnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.08 Å) and one longer (2.27 Å) Li-O bond length. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.29 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.21-2.71 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.64 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted OLi₃P trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent OLi₂SnP tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one OLi₃P trigonal pyramid. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂SnP tetrahedra. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
