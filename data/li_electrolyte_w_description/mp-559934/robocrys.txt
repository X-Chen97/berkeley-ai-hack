LiZnPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.03 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ZnO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.00 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent ZnO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.55 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
