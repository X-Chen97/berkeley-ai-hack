LiSrSnSbO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent LiO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.85 Å. Sr²⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent LiO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent SbO₆ octahedra. All Sr-O bond lengths are 2.85 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SbO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.05 Å. Sb⁵⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₁₂ cuboctahedra, and faces with four equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Sb-O bond lengths are 1.98 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sr²⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Sb⁵⁺ atom.
