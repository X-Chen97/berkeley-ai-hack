Li₂Ba₅U₃O₁₅ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six UO₆ octahedra and faces with eight BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 1-6°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.39 Å. There are two inequivalent Ba²⁺ sites. In the first Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent UO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 3.02-3.06 Å. In the second Ba²⁺ site, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with five UO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.87-3.21 Å. There are three inequivalent U⁶⁺ sites. In the first U⁶⁺ site, U⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form UO₆ octahedra that share corners with six UO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra.
