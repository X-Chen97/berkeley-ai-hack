Li₃Si₂BiO₇ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.06 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.38 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids, and  a cornercorner with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 40-63°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.70 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.49 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
