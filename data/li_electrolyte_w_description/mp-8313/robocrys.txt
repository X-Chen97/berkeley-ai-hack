Cs₂Li₂GeO₄ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are two inequivalent Cs¹⁺ sites. In the first Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 2.95-3.57 Å. In the second Cs¹⁺ site, Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.02-3.41 Å. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.21 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids,  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.07 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ trigonal pyramids and edges with two LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.76-1.83 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four Cs¹⁺, two Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to five Cs¹⁺ and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
