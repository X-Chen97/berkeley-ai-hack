Ba₂LiB₅O₁₀ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-1.96 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.69-3.07 Å. There are three inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.50 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.35 Å) and two longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the third B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.42 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites.
