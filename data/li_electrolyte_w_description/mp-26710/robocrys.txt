LiSnP₂O₇ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.14 Å. Sn³⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.76 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.60 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids.
