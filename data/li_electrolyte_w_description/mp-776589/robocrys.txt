Li₉Sb₃P₈O₂₉ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3c1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.46 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SbO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.16 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₆ octahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 76°. There is one shorter (1.79 Å) and three longer (2.12 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.36 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent SbO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra.
