LiH₂O₅Cl crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent ClO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.22 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent ClO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.10-2.26 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Cl⁷⁺ atom. The O-Cl bond length is 1.45 Å. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Cl⁷⁺ atom. The O-Cl bond length is 1.46 Å. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Cl⁷⁺ atom. The O-Cl bond length is 1.47 Å. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Cl⁷⁺ atom. The O-Cl bond length is 1.46 Å. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. Cl⁷⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form ClO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 40-48°.
