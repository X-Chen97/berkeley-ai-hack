Cs₂Li(O₃I)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. There are two inequivalent Cs sites. In the first Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to one Li and seven O atoms. The Cs-Li bond length is 2.93 Å. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 2.99-3.36 Å. In the second Cs site, Cs is bonded in a 12-coordinate geometry to twelve O atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.27-3.78 Å. Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Cs and three O atoms. There is one shorter (1.87 Å) and two longer (2.06 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to four Cs and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.83 Å. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Cs and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.85 Å. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Cs, one Li, and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 1.90 Å. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to three Cs, one Li, and one I atom. The O-I bond length is 2.11 Å. There are two inequivalent I sites. In the first I site, I is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O atoms. In the second I site, I is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O atoms.
