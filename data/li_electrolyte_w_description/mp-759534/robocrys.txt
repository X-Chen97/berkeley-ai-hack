LiBi₂(SO₄)₃ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.35 Å. Bi+2.50+ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (2.38 Å) and three longer (2.49 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 42°. There are two shorter (1.49 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi+2.50+, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi+2.50+ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
