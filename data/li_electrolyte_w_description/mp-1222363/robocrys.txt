LiLa₄AlO₈ is (La,Ba)CuO4-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmmm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 1°. There are four shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (2.29 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent La³⁺ sites. In the first La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.75 Å. In the second La³⁺ site, La³⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of La-O bond distances ranging from 2.46-2.76 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 1°. There are four shorter (1.84 Å) and two longer (2.16 Å) Al-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and five La³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to five La³⁺ and one Al³⁺ atom to form distorted OLa₅Al octahedra that share corners with seventeen OLiLa₄Al octahedra, edges with two equivalent OLa₅Al octahedra, and faces with four equivalent OLiLa₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-50°. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, four La³⁺, and one Al³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge, corner, and face-sharing OLiLa₄Al octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-50°.
