CsLiB₆O₁₀ crystallizes in the tetragonal I̅42d space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (3.29 Å) and four longer (3.59 Å) Cs-O bond lengths. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 1.97 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. All B-O bond lengths are 1.48 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.40 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺ and two equivalent B³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Cs¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two B³⁺ atoms.
