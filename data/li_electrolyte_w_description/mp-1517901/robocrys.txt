LiBaSnBiO₆ crystallizes in the cubic F̅43m space group. The structure consists of four Li clusters inside a BaSnBiO₆ framework. In each Li cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted cuboctahedral geometry to  atoms. In the BaSnBiO₆ framework, Ba²⁺ is bonded to twelve equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.96 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SnO₆ octahedra and faces with four equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.12 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two equivalent Ba²⁺, one Sn⁴⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom.
