Li₉Ga₃P₈O₂₉ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3c1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.07 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 68°. There is one shorter (1.85 Å) and three longer (2.12 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.40 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Ga-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 38°. There is one shorter (1.52 Å) and three longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-49°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.61 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms.
