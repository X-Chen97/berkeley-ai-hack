LiSbP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.78 Å. Sb³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SbO₅ square pyramids that share corners with five PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sb-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.36 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent SbO₅ square pyramids and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra.
