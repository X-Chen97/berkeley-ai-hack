K₂LiBO₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. There are three inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and six O²⁻ atoms. The K-Li bond length is 2.79 Å. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.63-2.99 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. All K-O bond lengths are 2.89 Å. In the third K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and eight O²⁻ atoms. Both K-Li bond lengths are 2.82 Å. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.71-3.14 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to two K¹⁺ and four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and face-sharing LiK₂O₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.05 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.42 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to five K¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
