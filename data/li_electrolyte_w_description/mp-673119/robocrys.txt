LiSn₂P₃O₁₀ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The structure consists of a LiSn₂P₃O₁₀ framework. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.84 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.18 Å) and one longer (2.23 Å) Sn-O bond length. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.66 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.52 Å) and two longer (1.59 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
