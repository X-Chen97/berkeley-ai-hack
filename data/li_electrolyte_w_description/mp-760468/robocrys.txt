LiSi₂BiO₆ is Esseneite structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.07 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 42-66°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.67 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.64 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and two equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms.
