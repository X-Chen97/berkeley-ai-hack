K₃Li₃P₆O₁₉ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. K is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.97-3.35 Å. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.02 Å. There are two inequivalent P sites. In the first P site, P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.64 Å. In the second P site, P is bonded to four O atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra.
