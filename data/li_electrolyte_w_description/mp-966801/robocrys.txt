LiCaBO₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Ibca space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, edges with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 1°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.09-2.26 Å. Ca²⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids, edges with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent CaO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 6°. There are a spread of Ca-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-2.52 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.38 Å) and two longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four equivalent Li¹⁺, one Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₄CaB octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 5°. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, three equivalent Ca²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
