LiBi₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.61 Å. Bi⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.22-2.43 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 28-59°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.56 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 33-47°. There are two shorter (1.54 Å) and two longer (1.56 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Bi⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi⁴⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Bi⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Bi⁴⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
