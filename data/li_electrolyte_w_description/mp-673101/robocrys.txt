LiSn₄(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.18 Å. There are two inequivalent Sn²⁺ sites. In the first Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.15-2.58 Å. In the second Sn²⁺ site, Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sn-O bond lengths are 2.35 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.55-1.57 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
