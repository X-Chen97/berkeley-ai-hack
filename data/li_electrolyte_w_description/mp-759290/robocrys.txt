Li₃Bi₂(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and faces with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.41 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.53 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  a faceface with one LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.31-2.46 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 14-57°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and corners with four equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 36-45°. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
