LiB(C₂O₄)₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.31 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.51 Å. There are three inequivalent C³⁺ sites. In the first C³⁺ site, C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.23 Å) and one longer (1.32 Å) C-O bond length. In the second C³⁺ site, C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.22 Å) and one longer (1.34 Å) C-O bond length. In the third C³⁺ site, C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.23 Å) and one longer (1.32 Å) C-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one B³⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one B³⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one B³⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom.
