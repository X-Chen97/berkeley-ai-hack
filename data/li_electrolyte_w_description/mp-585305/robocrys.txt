Li₉Bi₃P₈O₂₉ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3c1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.16 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 76°. There is one shorter (1.78 Å) and three longer (2.13 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.49 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.33-2.38 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 55-56°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra and corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 46°. There is one shorter (1.50 Å) and three longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
