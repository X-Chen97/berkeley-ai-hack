LiDyP₄O₁₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.01 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Dy³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Dy-O bond distances ranging from 2.29-2.56 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.61 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Dy³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Dy³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Dy³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Dy³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
