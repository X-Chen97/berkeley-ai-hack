LiSr₄(BO₃)₃ crystallizes in the cubic Ia̅3d space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in an octahedral geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.19 Å. There are two inequivalent Sr²⁺ sites. In the first Sr²⁺ site, Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.51-2.75 Å. In the second Sr²⁺ site, Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Sr-O bond lengths are 2.59 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.37 Å) and two longer (1.40 Å) B-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Sr²⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four Sr²⁺, and one B³⁺ atom.
