LiSr₂SiO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal P3_121 space group. Li is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.99 Å) and two longer (2.29 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.45-2.60 Å. Si is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O atoms. There are two shorter (1.65 Å) and two longer (1.67 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded to one Li, two equivalent Sr, and one Si atom to form distorted corner-sharing OSr₂LiSi tetrahedra. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, two equivalent Sr, and one Si atom.
