Li₃Bi(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the trigonal P̅3 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BiO₁₂ cuboctahedra,  a cornercorner with one BiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 66°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.09 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (1.95 Å) and three longer (2.57 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.32 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to twelve O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with six equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 41°. There are six shorter (2.62 Å) and six longer (2.84 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₁₂ cuboctahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (2.34 Å) and three longer (2.43 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BiO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 55-60°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.54-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃P tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
