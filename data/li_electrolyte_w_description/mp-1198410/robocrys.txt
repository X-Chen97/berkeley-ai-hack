LiCeS₂O₉ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded to four O atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.05 Å. Ce is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to nine O atoms. There are a spread of Ce-O bond distances ranging from 2.03-2.82 Å. There are two inequivalent S sites. In the first S site, S is bonded to four O atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.45-1.52 Å. In the second S site, S is bonded to four O atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.48 Å) and one longer (1.51 Å) S-O bond length. There are nine inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li and one S atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ce and one S atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li, one Ce, and one S atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Ce and one S atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li and one S atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Ce atom. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Ce and one S atom. In the eighth O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ce and one S atom. In the ninth O site, O is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ce and one S atom.
