LiGaGeO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.05 Å. Ga³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.82-1.90 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.75-1.82 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Ge⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Ga³⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
