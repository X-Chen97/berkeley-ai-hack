Li₂Bi(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li sites. In the first Li site, Li is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.06 Å. In the second Li site, Li is bonded to four O atoms to form distorted corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.01 Å. There are two inequivalent B sites. In the first B site, B is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.40 Å. In the second B site, B is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond length. Bi is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.62 Å. There are six inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li, one B, and one Bi atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li, one B, and one Bi atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li, one B, and one Bi atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, one B, and two equivalent Bi atoms. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li, one B, and one Bi atom. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, one B, and two equivalent Bi atoms.
