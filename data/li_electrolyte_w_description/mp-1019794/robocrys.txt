LiK₃P₂O₇ crystallizes in the orthorhombic C222₁ space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.84-2.87 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.71-2.92 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.00 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.65 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three K¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to three K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
