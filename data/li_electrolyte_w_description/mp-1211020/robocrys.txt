LiGa(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one GaO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (2.08 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are four shorter (1.97 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Ga-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one GaO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 44°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 44-49°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.51-1.60 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Ga³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Ga³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Ga³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
