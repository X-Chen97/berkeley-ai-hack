LiAlSiO₄ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6_222 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. All Al-O bond lengths are 1.75 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent AlO₄ tetrahedra. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.64 Å. O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
