CsLi₂(HO)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to six H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There are a spread of Cs-H bond distances ranging from 2.98-3.18 Å. The Cs-O bond length is 3.08 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.03 Å. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to three equivalent Cs¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Cs¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Cs¹⁺, two equivalent Li¹⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom.
