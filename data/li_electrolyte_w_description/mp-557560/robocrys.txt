LiNH₄SO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. The structure consists of four NH₄ clusters inside a LiSO₄ framework. In each NH₄ cluster, N³⁻ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four H¹⁺ atoms. There are two shorter (1.03 Å) and two longer (1.05 Å) N-H bond lengths. There are four inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom. In the LiSO₄ framework, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
