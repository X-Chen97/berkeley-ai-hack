LiNdPrO₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. Li is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Li-O bond lengths are 1.83 Å. Nd is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent O atoms. Both Nd-O bond lengths are 2.53 Å. Pr is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form distorted edge-sharing PrO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.42 Å) and four longer (2.86 Å) Pr-O bond lengths. O is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to one Li, one Nd, and three equivalent Pr atoms.
