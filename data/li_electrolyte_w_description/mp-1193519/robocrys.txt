LiU₂O₈Cl₃ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Li is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to four O and one Cl atom. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.50 Å. The Li-Cl bond length is 2.63 Å. There are two inequivalent U sites. In the first U site, U is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O and four Cl atoms. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.79-2.23 Å. There are a spread of U-Cl bond distances ranging from 2.78-2.94 Å. In the second U site, U is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to five O and two Cl atoms. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.79-2.37 Å. There is one shorter (2.76 Å) and one longer (2.92 Å) U-Cl bond length. There are eight inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li and one U atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one U atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one U atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li and one U atom. In the fifth O site, O is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three U atoms. In the sixth O site, O is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one U and one Cl atom. The O-Cl bond length is 2.39 Å. In the seventh O site, O is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li atom. In the eighth O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li and one O atom. The O-O bond length is 1.24 Å. There are three inequivalent Cl sites. In the first Cl site, Cl is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li, two U, and one O atom. In the second Cl site, Cl is bonded in a water-like geometry to two equivalent U atoms. In the third Cl site, Cl is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to two U atoms.
