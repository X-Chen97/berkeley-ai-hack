LiSr₂TeO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li is bonded to six O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 3-8°. There are four shorter (2.09 Å) and two longer (2.10 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr is bonded to twelve O atoms to form SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.74-2.96 Å. Te is bonded to six O atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent SrO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 3-8°. All Te-O bond lengths are 1.93 Å. There are three inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, four equivalent Sr, and one Te atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li, four equivalent Sr, and one Te atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, four equivalent Sr, and one Te atom.
