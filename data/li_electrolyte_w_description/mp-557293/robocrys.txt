Li₂CdSiO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent CdO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-1.99 Å. Cd²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted CdO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Cd-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.26 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent CdO₄ tetrahedra and corners with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.65 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLi₂CdSi tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂CdSi tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Cd²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
