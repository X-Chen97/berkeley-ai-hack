K₄Li(CO₃)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. There are three inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.75-3.06 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All K-O bond lengths are 2.57 Å. In the third K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both K-O bond lengths are 2.64 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.03 Å. C+3.50+ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.29 Å) and two longer (1.31 Å) C-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two K¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one C+3.50+ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to four K¹⁺ and one C+3.50+ atom.
