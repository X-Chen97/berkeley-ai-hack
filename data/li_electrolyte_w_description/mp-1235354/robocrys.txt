LiTl₆Si₂O₇ crystallizes in the trigonal P3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three equivalent Tl¹⁺ atoms. All Li-Tl bond lengths are 2.95 Å. There are two inequivalent Tl¹⁺ sites. In the first Tl¹⁺ site, Tl¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Tl-O bond distances ranging from 2.44-2.91 Å. In the second Tl¹⁺ site, Tl¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Tl-O bond distances ranging from 2.41-2.52 Å. Si³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Si-O bond lengths are 1.60 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (1.65 Å) and one longer (1.68 Å) Si-O bond length. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Tl¹⁺ and one Si³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Tl¹⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to three equivalent Tl¹⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
