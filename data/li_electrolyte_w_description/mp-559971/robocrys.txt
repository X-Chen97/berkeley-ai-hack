LiN(SO₂F)₂ crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SNO₂F tetrahedra and  a faceface with one LiO₆ pentagonal pyramid. There are three shorter (2.07 Å) and three longer (2.26 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ pentagonal pyramids that share corners with six equivalent SNO₂F tetrahedra and faces with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.17 Å. N³⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent S⁶⁺ atoms. Both N-S bond lengths are 1.57 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to one N³⁻, two O²⁻, and one F¹⁻ atom to form SNO₂F tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one LiO₆ pentagonal pyramid, and  a cornercorner with one SNO₂F tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-46°. There is one shorter (1.43 Å) and one longer (1.45 Å) S-O bond length. The S-F bond length is 1.60 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one S⁶⁺ atom.
