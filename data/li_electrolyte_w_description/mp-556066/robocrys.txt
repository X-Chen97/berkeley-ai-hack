Sr₂LiSiO₄F crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms to form LiO₃F₂ square pyramids that share corners with two equivalent LiO₃F₂ square pyramids and corners with three equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.02 Å) and one longer (2.04 Å) Li-O bond length. Both Li-F bond lengths are 2.04 Å. There are two inequivalent Sr²⁺ sites. In the first Sr²⁺ site, Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.60-3.10 Å. Both Sr-F bond lengths are 2.78 Å. In the second Sr²⁺ site, Sr²⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ and two equivalent F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sr-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.91 Å. Both Sr-F bond lengths are 2.63 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₃F₂ square pyramids. There is one shorter (1.63 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to four Sr²⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, four Sr²⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. F¹⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and four Sr²⁺ atoms.
