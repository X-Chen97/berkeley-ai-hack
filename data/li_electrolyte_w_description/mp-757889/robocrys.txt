LiSn(PO₃)₃ crystallizes in the orthorhombic P2_12_12₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.87 Å) and one longer (1.88 Å) Li-O bond length. Sn²⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted SnO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.49 Å. There are three inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one SnO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.64 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra and  a cornercorner with one SnO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.65 Å. In the third P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two PO₄ tetrahedra and corners with two equivalent SnO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are two shorter (1.51 Å) and two longer (1.59 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are nine inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms.
