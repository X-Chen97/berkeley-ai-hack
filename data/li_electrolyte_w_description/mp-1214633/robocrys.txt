LiBa₂TeO₆ is (Cubic) Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the cubic Fm̅3m space group. Li is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.22 Å. Ba is bonded to twelve equivalent O atoms to form BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with six equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra, faces with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and faces with four equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. All Ba-O bond lengths are 2.95 Å. Te is bonded to six equivalent O atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₆ octahedra and faces with eight equivalent BaO₁₂ cuboctahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra are not tilted. All Te-O bond lengths are 1.95 Å. O is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to one Li, four equivalent Ba, and one Te atom.
