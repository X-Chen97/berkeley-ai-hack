LiBa₂TbSnO₆ is Orthorhombic Perovskite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a square co-planar geometry to two equivalent Ba²⁺ and four equivalent O²⁻ atoms. Both Li-Ba bond lengths are 2.65 Å. All Li-O bond lengths are 2.07 Å. Ba²⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Ba-O bond distances ranging from 2.93-3.05 Å. Tb³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TbO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-4°. There are four shorter (2.21 Å) and two longer (2.38 Å) Tb-O bond lengths. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent TbO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-4°. There are four shorter (2.07 Å) and two longer (2.19 Å) Sn-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to four equivalent Ba²⁺, one Tb³⁺, and one Sn⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OBa₄TbSn octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 0-17°.
