LiPbPO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.93 Å) and two longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-1.95 Å. There are two inequivalent Pb²⁺ sites. In the first Pb²⁺ site, Pb²⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.38-3.26 Å. In the second Pb²⁺ site, Pb²⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.40-2.93 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with five LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.56 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.55 Å. There are eight inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to three Pb²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Pb²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the eighth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Pb²⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
