LiC₂H₃O₅ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.28 Å. There are two inequivalent C³⁺ sites. In the first C³⁺ site, C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.23 Å) and one longer (1.32 Å) C-O bond length. In the second C³⁺ site, C³⁺ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.25 Å) and one longer (1.28 Å) C-O bond length. There are three inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.08 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C³⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one C³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one C³⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms.
