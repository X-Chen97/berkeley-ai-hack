LiTb₂(PO₄)₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and two longer (2.01 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Tb³⁺ sites. In the first Tb³⁺ site, Tb³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Tb-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.56 Å. In the second Tb³⁺ site, Tb³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Tb-O bond distances ranging from 2.39-2.52 Å. P⁴⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.54 Å) and two longer (1.58 Å) P-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Tb³⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Tb³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Tb³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
