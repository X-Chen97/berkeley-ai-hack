LiUBO₅ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent UO₇ pentagonal bipyramids and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.10 Å. U⁶⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form distorted UO₇ pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent UO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. There are a spread of U-O bond distances ranging from 1.83-2.44 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.38 Å) and one longer (1.39 Å) B-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent U⁶⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one U⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one U⁶⁺, and one B³⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂UB tetrahedra. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent U⁶⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one U⁶⁺ atom.
