Li₃Bi₃(PO₄)₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.00-2.74 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.06 Å. There are two inequivalent Bi³⁺ sites. In the first Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to seven O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.81 Å. In the second Bi³⁺ site, Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.36 Å) and four longer (2.39 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BiO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra.
