Rb₂Li₁₄Pb₃O₁₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to ten O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 3.13-3.49 Å. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PbO₆ octahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with five LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 23-40°. There are two shorter (1.96 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three PbO₆ octahedra, corners with five LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 3-40°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.91-2.14 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PbO₆ octahedra, corners with seven LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 67°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.18 Å. There are two inequivalent Pb⁴⁺ sites. In the first Pb⁴⁺ site, Pb⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted PbO₆ octahedra that share corners with ten LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with six LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.42 Å. In the second Pb⁴⁺ site, Pb⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form PbO₆ octahedra that share corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.18 Å) and four longer (2.24 Å) Pb-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Rb¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one Pb⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to six Li¹⁺ and one Pb⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₆Pb hexagonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Rb¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and two Pb⁴⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Rb¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one Pb⁴⁺ atom.
