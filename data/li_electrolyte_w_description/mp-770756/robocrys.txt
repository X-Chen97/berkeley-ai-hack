There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.68 Å. B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.35-1.43 Å. Sn⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form SnO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.05-2.21 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SnO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 45-56°. There are three shorter (1.64 Å) and one longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom to form corner-sharing OLi₃B tetrahedra.
