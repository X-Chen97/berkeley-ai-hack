Li₃NaSiO₄ is Aluminum carbonitride-derived structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal I4₁/a space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.44-2.77 Å. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.96-2.06 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.16 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.47 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.65 Å) and two longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to one Na¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Na¹⁺, three Li¹⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
