LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.27-2.58 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.43 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, and  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 37-60°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.58 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to two equivalent P⁵⁺ atoms.
