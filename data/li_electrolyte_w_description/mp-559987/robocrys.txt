LiAl(PO₃)₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one AlO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (1.92 Å) and two longer (2.07 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Al³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form AlO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.89-1.92 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one AlO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 42°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.62 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent AlO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 42-47°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.50-1.60 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
