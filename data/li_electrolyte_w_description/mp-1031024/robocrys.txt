CsLiMg₆O₇ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4mm space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 9-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Mg²⁺ and five O²⁻ atoms. All Cs-Mg bond lengths are 2.70 Å. There are four shorter (2.44 Å) and one longer (2.79 Å) Cs-O bond length. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with four equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids and edges with eight MgO₆ octahedra. There is one shorter (1.81 Å) and four longer (2.34 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent Mg²⁺ sites. In the first Mg²⁺ site, Mg²⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form MgO₆ octahedra that share corners with six MgO₆ octahedra, edges with four equivalent MgO₆ octahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiO₅ square pyramids.
