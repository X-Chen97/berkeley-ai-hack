Li₂SnCSO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent SO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.99-2.54 Å. Sn²⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Sn-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.56 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of C-O bond distances ranging from 1.27-1.33 Å. S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₅ trigonal bipyramids. There is one shorter (1.47 Å) and three longer (1.50 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Sn²⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Sn²⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
