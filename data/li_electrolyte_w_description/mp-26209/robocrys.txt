LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.16 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six PO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.23-2.51 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 43-57°. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra,  a cornercorner with one PO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids.
