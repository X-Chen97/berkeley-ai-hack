LiC₈H₂₀O₄Cl is Indium-like structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of four LiC₈H₂₀O₄Cl clusters. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ and one Cl¹⁻ atom to form LiClO₄ trigonal bipyramids that share corners with four CH₃O tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.12 Å) and two longer (2.14 Å) Li-O bond lengths. The Li-Cl bond length is 2.42 Å. There are two inequivalent C¹⁻ sites. In the first C¹⁻ site, C¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. Both C-H bond lengths are 1.11 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.44 Å. In the second C¹⁻ site, C¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.10 Å) and one longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond length. The C-O bond length is 1.44 Å. There are two inequivalent C²⁻ sites. In the first C²⁻ site, C²⁻ is bonded to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom to form CH₃O tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiClO₄ trigonal bipyramid. All C-H bond lengths are 1.10 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.44 Å. In the second C²⁻ site, C²⁻ is bonded to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom to form CH₃O tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiClO₄ trigonal bipyramid. All C-H bond lengths are 1.10 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. There are ten inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. In the fifth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the sixth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the seventh H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. In the eighth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the ninth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C²⁻ atom. In the tenth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C¹⁻ atom. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C¹⁻, and one C²⁻ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one C¹⁻, and one C²⁻ atom. Cl¹⁻ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one Li¹⁺ atom.
