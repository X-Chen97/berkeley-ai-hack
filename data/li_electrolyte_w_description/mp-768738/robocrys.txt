Li₃Bi(BO₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one BiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.16 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.14 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent BiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.36 Å) and two longer (1.41 Å) B-O bond lengths. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.36-1.42 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.20-2.39 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to three Li¹⁺ and one B³⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
