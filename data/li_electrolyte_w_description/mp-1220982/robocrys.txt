NaLiGa₂(SiO₃)₄ is Esseneite-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Na¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Na-O bond distances ranging from 2.36-2.39 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.47 Å. There are two inequivalent Ga³⁺ sites. In the first Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.12 Å. In the second Ga³⁺ site, Ga³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form GaO₆ octahedra that share corners with six SiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent GaO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Ga-O bond distances ranging from 1.93-2.11 Å. There are two inequivalent Si⁴⁺ sites. In the first Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 35-60°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.61-1.66 Å. In the second Si⁴⁺ site, Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three GaO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 38-59°. There is one shorter (1.61 Å) and three longer (1.65 Å) Si-O bond lengths. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to one Li¹⁺, two Ga³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OLiGa₂Si tetrahedra.
