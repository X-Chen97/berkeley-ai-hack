CsLiH₄S₂(NO₃)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P̅1 space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 10-coordinate geometry to one N³⁻ and nine O²⁻ atoms. The Cs-N bond length is 3.57 Å. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 3.18-3.57 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SNO₃ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.01 Å. There are two inequivalent N³⁻ sites. In the first N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Cs¹⁺, two H¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. There is one shorter (1.03 Å) and one longer (1.04 Å) N-H bond length. The N-S bond length is 1.67 Å. In the second N³⁻ site, N³⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. Both N-H bond lengths are 1.03 Å. The N-S bond length is 1.67 Å. There are four inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one N³⁻ atom.
