LiInSiO₄ is Ilmenite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent InO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent InO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 56-65°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.19-2.21 Å. In³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form InO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent InO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one SiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-65°. There are a spread of In-O bond distances ranging from 2.13-2.27 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent InO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one InO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 54-59°. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.68 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent In³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one In³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one In³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
