(LiSO₄)₂N₂ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. The structure consists of four N₂ clusters inside a LiSO₄ framework. In each N₂ cluster, N¹⁺ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to  atoms. In the LiSO₄ framework, there are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.97 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four SO₄ tetrahedra. There are three shorter (1.96 Å) and one longer (1.97 Å) Li-O bond length. There are two inequivalent S⁶⁺ sites. In the first S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.47-1.49 Å. In the second S⁶⁺ site, S⁶⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (1.48 Å) and two longer (1.49 Å) S-O bond lengths. There are eight inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the eighth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
