LiScGeO₄ is Hausmannite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent ScO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, edges with two equivalent ScO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 55-61°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.11-2.36 Å. Sc³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form ScO₆ octahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent ScO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent GeO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, and  an edgeedge with one GeO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 47-61°. There are a spread of Sc-O bond distances ranging from 2.08-2.22 Å. Ge⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form GeO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent ScO₆ octahedra,  an edgeedge with one ScO₆ octahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 53-62°. There are a spread of Ge-O bond distances ranging from 1.74-1.81 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂ScGe tetrahedra. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Sc³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, two equivalent Sc³⁺, and one Ge⁴⁺ atom.
