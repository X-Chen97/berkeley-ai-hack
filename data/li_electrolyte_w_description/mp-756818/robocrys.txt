LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal R̅3 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids, corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one BiO₅ square pyramid. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.01-2.11 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with two equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, and corners with four equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.62-1.69 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded to five O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₅ square pyramids that share corners with two equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids, corners with two equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids, edges with two equivalent BiO₅ square pyramids, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ trigonal pyramid. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.12-2.46 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Si⁴⁺ atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺ and three equivalent Bi³⁺ atoms.
