LiHTeO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic Pm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six TeO₆ octahedra and corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 49-60°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.95-2.19 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.64 Å) H-O bond length. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.02 Å) and one longer (1.59 Å) H-O bond length. There are two inequivalent Te⁶⁺ sites. In the first Te⁶⁺ site, Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.03 Å. In the second Te⁶⁺ site, Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-2.03 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one H¹⁺ and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one H¹⁺ and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Te⁶⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two Te⁶⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂TeH trigonal pyramids. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂TeH trigonal pyramids.
