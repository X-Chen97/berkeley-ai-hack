KLiPH₂O₄F crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.78-3.02 Å. The K-F bond length is 2.80 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent PO₃F tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.02 Å. P⁵⁺ is bonded to three O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom to form PO₃F tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.52 Å) and two longer (1.53 Å) P-O bond lengths. The P-F bond length is 1.63 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.99 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom.
