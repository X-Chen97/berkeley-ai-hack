K₂LiS₂(O₂F)₂ crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group. There are two inequivalent K¹⁺ sites. In the first K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 7-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There are a spread of K-O bond distances ranging from 2.78-3.04 Å. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.45-3.29 Å. In the second K¹⁺ site, K¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two O²⁻ and three F¹⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.85 Å) and one longer (2.97 Å) K-O bond length. There are a spread of K-F bond distances ranging from 2.51-2.98 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.88 Å) and one longer (2.02 Å) Li-O bond length. The Li-F bond length is 1.92 Å. S³⁺ is bonded in a water-like geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.51 Å) and one longer (1.54 Å) S-O bond length. S⁴⁺ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two O²⁻ and one F¹⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.46 Å) and one longer (1.48 Å) S-O bond length. The S-F bond length is 2.08 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two K¹⁺ and one S³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺ and one S⁴⁺ atom.
