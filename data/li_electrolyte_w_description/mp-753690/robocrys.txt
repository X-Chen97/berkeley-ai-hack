Li₄(OH)₃Br crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and one Br¹⁻ atom. There are two shorter (1.97 Å) and one longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond length. The Li-Br bond length is 2.75 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and one Br¹⁻ atom. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-1.99 Å. The Li-Br bond length is 2.70 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three O²⁻ and one Br¹⁻ atom. There are two shorter (1.95 Å) and one longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond length. The Li-Br bond length is 2.63 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.98 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to four Li¹⁺ and one H¹⁺ atom. Br¹⁻ is bonded in a distorted tetrahedral geometry to four Li¹⁺ atoms.
