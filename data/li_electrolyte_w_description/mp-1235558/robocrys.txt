LiY₃(PO₄)₃ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (1.84 Å) and two longer (2.00 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Y³⁺ sites. In the first Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded to seven O²⁻ atoms to form distorted YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids that share corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, corners with three equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one YO₇ pentagonal bipyramid, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.32-2.49 Å. In the second Y³⁺ site, Y³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Y-O bond distances ranging from 2.28-2.66 Å. P⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids. There are two shorter (1.55 Å) and two longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent YO₇ pentagonal bipyramids and  an edgeedge with one YO₇ pentagonal bipyramid. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.53-1.57 Å. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Y³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Y³⁺ and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 1-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Y³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Y³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, two Y³⁺, and one P⁴⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted water-like geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Y³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
