LiSrAl₂B₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic C2 space group. Li is bonded in a distorted T-shaped geometry to three O atoms. There is one shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (2.36 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Sr is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O atoms. There are four shorter (2.59 Å) and two longer (2.64 Å) Sr-O bond lengths. Al is bonded to four O atoms to form corner-sharing AlO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.73-1.82 Å. B is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.38-1.40 Å. There are four inequivalent O sites. In the first O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Sr, one Al, and one B atom. In the second O site, O is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Sr, one Al, and one B atom. In the third O site, O is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li, one Sr, one Al, and one B atom. In the fourth O site, O is bonded in a T-shaped geometry to one Li and two equivalent Al atoms.
