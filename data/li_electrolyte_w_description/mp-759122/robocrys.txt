LiBiP₂O₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.63 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.37-2.80 Å. There are two inequivalent P⁵⁺ sites. In the first P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.63 Å. In the second P⁵⁺ site, P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form corner-sharing PO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of P-O bond distances ranging from 1.52-1.61 Å. There are seven inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 120 degrees geometry to two P⁵⁺ atoms. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to one Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the seventh O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Bi³⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom.
