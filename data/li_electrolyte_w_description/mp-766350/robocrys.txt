LiSiBiO₄ is Chalcostibite-derived structured and crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.01 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.63-1.68 Å. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Bi-O bond distances ranging from 2.18-2.41 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom.
