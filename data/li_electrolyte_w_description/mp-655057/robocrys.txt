LiAlSiH₂O₅ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.88-1.95 Å. Al³⁺ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Al-O bond distances ranging from 1.70-1.96 Å. Si⁴⁺ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Si-O bond distances ranging from 1.60-1.75 Å. There are two inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one O²⁻ atom. The H-O bond length is 0.97 Å. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.01 Å) and one longer (1.65 Å) H-O bond length. There are five inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted L-shaped geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one H¹⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two H¹⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Al³⁺, and one Si⁴⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a bent 150 degrees geometry to one Al³⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
