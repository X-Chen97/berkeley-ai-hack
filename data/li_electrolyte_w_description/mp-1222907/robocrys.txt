LiH₂₀(C₂O)₄PH₂ is Indium-derived structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The structure is zero-dimensional and consists of four LiH₂₀(C₂O)₄ clusters and four PH₂ clusters. In each LiH₂₀(C₂O)₄ cluster, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a see-saw-like geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are two shorter (2.15 Å) and two longer (2.20 Å) Li-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent C+2.50- sites. In the first C+2.50- site, C+2.50- is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. All C-H bond lengths are 1.10 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. In the second C+2.50- site, C+2.50- is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.10 Å) and one longer (1.11 Å) C-H bond length. The C-O bond length is 1.44 Å. In the third C+2.50- site, C+2.50- is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to two H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. Both C-H bond lengths are 1.10 Å. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. In the fourth C+2.50- site, C+2.50- is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to three H¹⁺ and one O²⁻ atom. There is one shorter (1.09 Å) and two longer (1.10 Å) C-H bond lengths. The C-O bond length is 1.43 Å. There are ten inequivalent H¹⁺ sites. In the first H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the second H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the third H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the fourth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the fifth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the sixth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the seventh H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the eighth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the ninth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. In the tenth H¹⁺ site, H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one C+2.50- atom. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two C+2.50- atoms. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two C+2.50- atoms. In each PH₂ cluster, P⁵⁺ is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to two equivalent H¹⁺ atoms. Both P-H bond lengths are 1.43 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a single-bond geometry to one P⁵⁺ atom.
