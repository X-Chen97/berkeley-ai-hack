LiHTeO₄ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁ space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with six equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 49-60°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.92-2.21 Å. H¹⁺ is bonded in a linear geometry to two O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.06 Å) and one longer (1.46 Å) H-O bond length. Te⁶⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form TeO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra and edges with two equivalent TeO₆ octahedra. There are a spread of Te-O bond distances ranging from 1.86-2.03 Å. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal non-coplanar geometry to one Li¹⁺, one H¹⁺, and one Te⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Te⁶⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Li¹⁺ and two equivalent Te⁶⁺ atoms.
