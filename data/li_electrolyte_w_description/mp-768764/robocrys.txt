Li₂BBiO₅ crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with four equivalent BO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with four equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 29°. There are four shorter (2.16 Å) and two longer (2.30 Å) Li-O bond lengths. B³⁺ is bonded to four equivalent O²⁻ atoms to form BO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with eight equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 55°. All B-O bond lengths are 1.49 Å. Bi⁵⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (2.04 Å) and four longer (2.14 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted rectangular see-saw-like geometry to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one B³⁺, and one Bi⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to four equivalent Li¹⁺ and one Bi⁵⁺ atom.
