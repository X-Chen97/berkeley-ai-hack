LiCsSO₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. Cs¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Cs-O bond distances ranging from 2.92-3.18 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.86 Å) and two longer (1.93 Å) Li-O bond lengths. S⁶⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of S-O bond distances ranging from 1.48-1.50 Å. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 150 degrees geometry to one Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to one Cs¹⁺, one Li¹⁺, and one S⁶⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted single-bond geometry to two equivalent Cs¹⁺ and one S⁶⁺ atom.
