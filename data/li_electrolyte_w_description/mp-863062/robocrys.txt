LiSiBiO₄ crystallizes in the trigonal P31c space group. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with four equivalent SiO₄ tetrahedra. There is one shorter (1.88 Å) and three longer (1.94 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Si⁴⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent LiO₄ trigonal pyramids. There is one shorter (1.61 Å) and three longer (1.66 Å) Si-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent O²⁻ atoms. All Bi-O bond lengths are 2.17 Å. There are two inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Si⁴⁺, and one Bi³⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a linear geometry to one Li¹⁺ and one Si⁴⁺ atom.
