Li₃ZnCPO₇ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2₁/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to five O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.94-2.48 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.06-2.65 Å. Zn²⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Zn-O bond distances ranging from 2.04-2.47 Å. C⁴⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.29 Å) and two longer (1.30 Å) C-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded in a tetrahedral geometry to four O²⁻ atoms. There are three shorter (1.55 Å) and one longer (1.57 Å) P-O bond length. There are six inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a distorted bent 120 degrees geometry to three Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to three Li¹⁺ and one C⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing OLi₃C tetrahedra. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one C⁴⁺ atom. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the fifth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form OLi₂ZnP tetrahedra that share corners with four equivalent OLi₂ZnP trigonal pyramids and  an edgeedge with one OLi₃C tetrahedra. In the sixth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to two equivalent Li¹⁺, one Zn²⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom to form distorted corner-sharing OLi₂ZnP trigonal pyramids.
