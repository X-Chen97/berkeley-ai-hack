RbLi₂B₃Sb₂O₉ crystallizes in the monoclinic P2/c space group. Rb¹⁺ is bonded in a 8-coordinate geometry to eight O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of Rb-O bond distances ranging from 2.91-3.49 Å. Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one LiO₄ tetrahedra and corners with three equivalent SbO₄ trigonal pyramids. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.98-2.14 Å. There are two inequivalent B³⁺ sites. In the first B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There are a spread of B-O bond distances ranging from 1.37-1.42 Å. In the second B³⁺ site, B³⁺ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O²⁻ atoms. There is one shorter (1.34 Å) and two longer (1.43 Å) B-O bond lengths. Sb³⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form SbO₄ trigonal pyramids that share corners with three equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra.
