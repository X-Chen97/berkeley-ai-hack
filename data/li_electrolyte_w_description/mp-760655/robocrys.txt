Li₃Bi(PO₄)₂ is Esseneite-like structured and crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. There are two inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one PO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 69-81°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 2.04-2.10 Å. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent BiO₆ octahedra. There are two shorter (2.15 Å) and four longer (2.22 Å) Li-O bond lengths. Bi³⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form BiO₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, corners with six equivalent PO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two equivalent LiO₆ octahedra. There are four shorter (2.38 Å) and two longer (2.41 Å) Bi-O bond lengths. P⁵⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form PO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three equivalent LiO₆ octahedra, corners with three equivalent BiO₆ octahedra, corners with two equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra, and  an edgeedge with one LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 30-63°. There is one shorter (1.53 Å) and three longer (1.58 Å) P-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺ and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to one Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to two Li¹⁺, one Bi³⁺, and one P⁵⁺ atom.
