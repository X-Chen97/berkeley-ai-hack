[Description]
K₂Li₁₄Pb₃O₁₄ crystallizes in the orthorhombic Immm space group. K¹⁺ is bonded in a 6-coordinate geometry to six O²⁻ atoms. There are four shorter (3.05 Å) and two longer (3.23 Å) K-O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent Li¹⁺ sites. In the first Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with four PbO₆ octahedra, corners with six LiO₄ tetrahedra, and edges with five LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 22-41°. There are two shorter (1.94 Å) and two longer (1.98 Å) Li-O bond lengths. In the second Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share corners with three PbO₆ octahedra, corners with five LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles range from 4-40°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.90-2.17 Å. In the third Li¹⁺ site, Li¹⁺ is bonded to four O²⁻ atoms to form distorted LiO₄ tetrahedra that share  a cornercorner with one PbO₆ octahedra, corners with seven LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with three LiO₄ tetrahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 67°. There are a spread of Li-O bond distances ranging from 1.97-2.16 Å. There are two inequivalent Pb⁴⁺ sites. In the first Pb⁴⁺ site, Pb⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form distorted PbO₆ octahedra that share corners with ten LiO₄ tetrahedra,  an edgeedge with one PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with six LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are a spread of Pb-O bond distances ranging from 2.17-2.41 Å. In the second Pb⁴⁺ site, Pb⁴⁺ is bonded to six O²⁻ atoms to form PbO₆ octahedra that share corners with eight LiO₄ tetrahedra, edges with two equivalent PbO₆ octahedra, and edges with eight equivalent LiO₄ tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.18 Å) and four longer (2.24 Å) Pb-O bond lengths. There are four inequivalent O²⁻ sites. In the first O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to one K¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one Pb⁴⁺ atom. In the second O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded to six Li¹⁺ and one Pb⁴⁺ atom to form a mixture of distorted edge and corner-sharing OLi₆Pb hexagonal pyramids. In the third O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three Li¹⁺ and two Pb⁴⁺ atoms. In the fourth O²⁻ site, O²⁻ is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to two equivalent K¹⁺, four Li¹⁺, and one Pb⁴⁺ atom.
